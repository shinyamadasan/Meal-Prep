## 2026-06-25 — P2 Task 3: Dismiss a suggested grocery item

**Built:**
- `dismissSuggestedGroceryItem(itemId)`: removes from `AppState.groceryList`, sets `pantryItem.suggestDismissed = true`, calls `saveData()` + re-renders.
- ✕ dismiss button on suggested items in `renderGroceryList()` (inside the name row, `event.stopPropagation()` prevents row-toggle).
- `syncStapleToGrocery()`: skips push when `p.suggestDismissed`; clears flag when `stockLevel` returns to `full`/`ok`.
- `checkAndReplenishLowStock()` (non-staple path): skips add when `p.suggestDismissed`; `delete p.suggestDismissed` on restock.
- `.grocery-dismiss-btn` CSS: unobtrusive (low-opacity ×), red on hover.
- DATA_MODEL.md updated with `suggestDismissed` pantry field and `stockLevel` clarification.
**Self Review:** pass (focused function, clear responsibility split, correct flag lifecycle). **QA:** pass (all 4 criteria met; XSS-safe; pantry data untouched; light-only safe).
**Files changed:** `app.js`, `style.css`, `docs/DATA_MODEL.md`, `planning/DONE.md`, `planning/ROADMAP.md`, `planning/TASK.md`, `STATUS.md`.
**Branch:** `main` — committing now.
**Next:** Queue empty. Waiting for human to promote next task or send capture.

## 2026-06-25 — P2 Task 2: "Suggested" badge on auto-added grocery items

**Built:** Added `grocery-suggested-badge` to the `grocery-item-name` div in `renderGroceryList()` — renders only when `item.suggested === true`, with `suggestedReason` as the `title` tooltip (XSS-safe via `escapeHtml`). CSS `.grocery-suggested-badge` mirrors `.pantry-badge` with amber colors (`#fef3c7` bg / `#92400e` text) — light-only safe, no dark-mode block.
**Self Review:** pass (reuses pantry-badge pattern exactly; `escapeHtml` on tooltip). **QA:** pass (non-suggested items unchanged; XSS-safe; no light-only invariant violation).
**Files changed:** `app.js`, `style.css`, `planning/DONE.md`, `planning/ROADMAP.md`, `planning/TASK.md`, `STATUS.md`.
**Next:** P2 Task 3 — Dismiss a suggested grocery item (dismiss control + re-add prevention).

---

## 2026-06-25 — P2 Task 1: `suggested` flag on auto-added grocery items

**Built:** Added `suggested: true` and `suggestedReason: 'low stock'` to the grocery item push in both auto-add sites — `syncStapleToGrocery()` (staple path) and `checkAndReplenishLowStock()` (non-staple below-minQty path). Additive only — no existing logic changed. Flag persists through `saveData()` as plain JSON. DATA_MODEL.md updated with grocery item shape and `mealPrepHelpSeen` localStorage entry.
**Self Review:** pass (minimal additive change; same field names in both sites). **QA:** pass (both auto-add paths flagged; manual-add paths untouched; JSON-serializable).
**Files changed:** `app.js`, `docs/DATA_MODEL.md`, `planning/DONE.md`, `planning/ROADMAP.md`, `planning/TASK.md`, `STATUS.md`.
**Next:** P2 Task 2 — "Suggested" badge in the grocery list rendering.

---

## 2026-06-25 — Alpha P1: one onboarding gate (no double-modal on first run)

**Problem:** On first run, `initApp()` scheduled `openHelpModal` after 600ms AND `seedPantryIfEmpty()` opened the Kitchen Setup Wizard synchronously — two modals stacked before the user reached the app.
**Fix (3-line gate):** In the `mealPrepHelpSeen` block, only schedule `openHelpModal` if `pantryOnboardingDone` is already set. When it's absent, the wizard is about to fire, so Help skips. Both flags are checked directly in `localStorage` — no AppState reads needed at that early point in `initApp()`.
**Behaviour after fix:** Brand-new user → wizard only. Returning user (both flags set) → neither auto-opens. Edge: user cleared only `mealPrepHelpSeen` but wizard already done → Help opens normally. All acceptance criteria met. `openHelpModal()` reachable via Settings unchanged.
**Triage:** One capture (`20260625T2227Z-10-feature`) in inbox — confirmed the same priority, archived, no new task created.
**Self Review:** pass (reuses existing `localStorage.getItem` pattern; minimum change; `mealPrepHelpSeen` still set on first run so it doesn't re-open). **QA:** pass.
**Files changed:** `app.js`, `docs/FEATURES.md`, `planning/DONE.md`, `planning/ROADMAP.md`, `planning/TASK.md`, `STATUS.md`, `captures/processed/2026/06/20260625T2227Z-10-feature.md`.
**Branch:** `main` — committing now.
**Next:** P2 drain chain — Task 1: flag auto-suggested low-stock grocery items.

---

## 2026-06-25 — Queued an alpha P1 ahead of tonight's drain; Job #5 preserved

**Queue (top → bottom) for tonight's run:**
1. **Alpha P1 — one onboarding modal on first run** (don't stack Help over the Kitchen Setup Wizard). Friction removal, first impression.
2–4. The P2 low-stock dependency chain (flag → badge → dismiss) — drain test.
**Job #5** ("cheapest") is recorded in ROADMAP as **⏳ decision-pending, do-NOT-auto-build** — preserved, the run must skip it (human decides: descope vs build).
**Tonight:** 9 PM run builds the alpha P1 first, then drains the P2 chain. First unattended run of the new pipeline + QA/Self-Review gates — review `DONE.md`/commits in the morning.
**Branch:** `main` — committed + pushed.
**Blockers:** none.

---

## 2026-06-25 — Alpha P1: "Sample" badge on seeded recipes (Job #3 clarity)

**Why highest-priority:** Job #1 done; Job #4's grocery empty state already guides; Job #5 is a product
decision reserved for the human. The top *implementable* P1 was the Cook tab showing 26 recipes a
first-timer never added ("are these mine?"). On the primary nav, unguided, undermines the differentiator.
**Built:** `isSampleRecipe()` (membership in `sampleRecipes` by id) + a "Sample" badge in the recipe
card header (`#recipe card`), styled with `.recipe-sample-badge` (tokens, mirrors `.recipe-category`).
Derived at render (no state, no data change), reuses card rendering, no redesign.
**Self Review:** pass. **QA:** pass (symbol pair intact, light-only clean, no secrets, XSS-safe static badge). **Verification:** code-trace; eyeball on device.
**Files changed:** `app.js`, `style.css`, `docs/FEATURES.md`, `planning/DONE.md`, `STATUS.md`.
**Branch:** `main` — committed (push pending).
**Next P1 (recommend, do NOT auto-implement):** the **Job #5 decision** — descope "cheapest" (reframe Price Book as a price *reference*) vs build a minimal basket-per-store compare. It's the last external-testing blocker and a product call. Lesser P1: verify cook-suggestion reliability with the wizard-seeded pantry.
**Blockers:** none.

---

## 2026-06-25 — Product prompts added to PROMPTS.md (PP1–PP7)

**Completed:** Split `PROMPTS.md` into **⚙️ Engineering (P1–P10)** and **🎯 Product (PP1–PP7)**.
The product prompts: PP1 Internal Alpha Audit · PP2 UX Friction Audit · PP3 First-Time User Audit ·
PP4 Feature Simplification · PP5 Release Readiness · PP6 User Research Analysis · PP7 Post-Test
Improvement Sprint. They produce **findings/decisions routed into ROADMAP**, not features — honoring
the no-new-features / prefer-simplify constraint and the QA honesty rule (flag human-verified, don't
claim it). Updated `AI-DEV-OS.md` (manifest) + `CLAUDE.md` (doc map). Part of the v1.0 template.
**Self Review:** pass (consistent format, reuse, defers to system docs). **QA:** pass (docs only).
**Files changed:** `PROMPTS.md`, `AI-DEV-OS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `STATUS.md`, `planning/DONE.md`.
**Branch:** `main` — pushed.
**Next task:** Remaining alpha quick wins (sample-recipe badge, one first-launch modal) + the Job #5 decision.
**Blockers:** none.

---

## 2026-06-25 — Alpha quick wins: pantry add-feedback + Price Book naming

**Built (2 trust/feedback fixes from the alpha audit):**
1. **Add-feedback toasts** — `addToPantry()` now confirms: `Added "X" to your kitchen`, or
   `"X" is already in your kitchen` (was a silent no-op). Reuses `showSuccessMessage` (textContent →
   XSS-safe). Answers Job #1 directly: type a name, get told if you already have it.
2. **Naming consistency** — the "Price Book" tab opened a screen titled "Ingredient Catalog"; heading
   renamed to **Price Book** to match the tab (trust).
**Self Review:** pass (smallest impl, reuse, did not touch the out-of-scope orphaned qty read).
**QA:** pass (toast textContent-safe; no theme/state change; no secrets). **Verification:** code-trace.
**Files changed:** `app.js`, `index.html`, `docs/FEATURES.md`, `planning/DONE.md`, `STATUS.md`.
**Branch:** `main` — pushed.
**Next task:** Remaining alpha quick wins — "Sample" badge on seeded recipes; collapse first-launch to one modal; then the Job #5 decision (descope vs minimal store-compare).
**Blockers:** none.

---

## 2026-06-25 — Pantry search (Internal Alpha: "did I already buy garlic?")

**Task:** Add real-time pantry search so a growing kitchen stays scannable (Job #1).
**Built:** `#pantry-search` field above the pantry list. Filters by name on input (wired
`addEventListener('input', renderPantry)` — matches the recipe-search pattern); `renderPantry()`
filters within each storage group (grouping preserved), shows an encouraging "No matches" empty state,
and hides the field when the pantry is empty. Reused `emptyState`, `.form-control`, existing tokens —
no redesign, no new state (transient view filter). Files: `index.html`, `app.js`, `style.css`.
**Self Review:** pass (smallest impl, reuse, no debt; search input is a sibling of `#pantry-list` so it
keeps focus while typing). **QA:** pass (ref pair intact, light-only invariant clean, no secrets, all 6
acceptance criteria traced). **Verification:** code-trace only — eyeball on device after deploy.
**Files changed:** `index.html`, `app.js`, `style.css`, `docs/FEATURES.md`, `planning/DONE.md`, `STATUS.md`.
**Branch:** `main` — on disk, not yet committed.
**Next task:** Other alpha quick wins (add-feedback toast, Price Book naming, sample-recipe badge) — see the alpha audit.
**Blockers:** none.

---

## 2026-06-25 — METRICS.md + OS locked at v1.0; product direction set

**Completed:**
- New `METRICS.md` — weekly engineering metrics, each tagged Auto (git/files) vs Manual (honesty rule). Seeded an honest bootstrap baseline (1 user-facing feature, 3 fixes, 0 reverts, 4 captures, no autonomous builds yet — labeled as baseline, not steady-state).
- **AI Dev OS locked at v1.0** (`AI-DEV-OS.md`) — stop refining the workflow; build the product.
- Product direction (5 sprints) added to `planning/ROADMAP.md`: polish → user testing (5–10 real users) → fix → product intelligence → public beta. North star: **10 users > more features.**
- Registered `METRICS.md` in `CLAUDE.md`.
**Files changed:** `METRICS.md` (new), `AI-DEV-OS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `planning/ROADMAP.md`, `STATUS.md`.
**Branch:** `main` — on disk, not yet committed.
**Next mission (human):** get **10 people using the app** — collect where they stick / ignore / delight / confuse. That feedback > more workflow refinement.
**Blockers:** none.

---

## 2026-06-25 — AI-DEV-OS.md template manifest (app-creation system)

**Task:** Make the AI Dev OS reusable — define the template so new apps inherit the full pipeline.
**Completed:** New `AI-DEV-OS.md` — manifest of **generic** OS files (clone as-is: WORKFLOW, SELF_REVIEW,
QA, PROMPTS, OPERATOR, GUIDE, CLAUDE router, run-claude.ps1, n8n workflow, captures/planning/STATUS
scaffolds) vs **app-specific** files (CLAUDE project block + hard rules, all of docs/, QA `[app]`
checks), plus a 7-step new-app bootstrap. Self Review + QA are now part of the template. Registered in
`CLAUDE.md`; ROADMAP "extract ai-dev-os" Research item updated (manifest done, repo lift remains).
Also pushed: the light-only fix (`7cb87f5`) — **now live, ready for the dark-mode phone test.**
**Files changed:** `AI-DEV-OS.md` (new), `CLAUDE.md`, `planning/ROADMAP.md`, `STATUS.md`.
**Branch:** `main` — on disk, not yet committed.
**Next task:** Verify light-only on a dark-mode phone (live). 3-task drain chain still queued for tonight.
**Blockers:** none.

---

## 2026-06-25 — Self Review event + SELF_REVIEW.md (code health, "would I ship this?")

**Task:** Separate "is it *good code*?" (Self Review) from "does it *work*?" (QA) as distinct gates.
**Completed:** New `SELF_REVIEW.md` — Code Health checklist (duplication, magic numbers, complexity,
dead code, TODOs, reuse, naming, unnecessary state/DOM queries, extract-to-helper) + the one-question
gate **"Would I ship this?"** ("Almost" = not done). All items AI-verifiable by reading the diff;
honesty rule preserved (human-only aspects → `ship-pending-human-review`, never claimed verified).
Lifecycle: **Execution → Self Review → Task Completion → QA gate → Commit.** Wired into `WORKFLOW.md`
(new event 4, renumbered, diagram, file map), `CLAUDE.md` (doc map + lifecycle), `PROMPTS.md` (P10),
`run-claude.ps1` (COMPLETED branch). Recorded as DECISIONS **D-014**.
**Files changed:** `SELF_REVIEW.md` (new), `WORKFLOW.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `PROMPTS.md`, `run-claude.ps1`, `docs/DECISIONS.md`, `STATUS.md`.
**Branch:** `main` — on disk, not yet committed.
**Next task:** 3-task dependency chain still queued for tonight's drain (now gated by Self Review + QA).
**Blockers:** none.

---

## 2026-06-25 — QA.md pre-commit quality gate added to the OS

**Task:** Add a mandatory, AI-runnable QA checklist before every production commit.
**Completed:** New `QA.md` — 6 sections (Functional / Visual & Responsive / Regression / Data
Integrity / Documentation / Git Hygiene), each item grep/trace-verifiable by an agent, grounded in
this repo's hard rules (`[app]`-tagged). Explicit **AI-verifiable vs Human-verifiable** split: AI
checks gate the commit (fail → Blocked); human checks (phone feel, polish, copy, real-device render)
are logged to STATUS, never block a run. Wired in: `WORKFLOW.md` Commit event + file map, `CLAUDE.md`
doc map + lifecycle, `run-claude.ps1` COMPLETED branch.
**Files changed:** `QA.md` (new), `WORKFLOW.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `run-claude.ps1`, `STATUS.md`.
**Branch:** `main` — on disk, not yet committed.
**Next task:** Queue still holds the 3-task dependency chain for tonight's drain (now gated by QA.md).
**Blockers:** none.

---

## 2026-06-25 — Light-only release: force light, remove dark mode (D-013)

**Why:** Dark-mode phones auto-applied a broken/inconsistent dark theme + darkened native controls, eroding trust. Product decision: ship one polished light theme.
**Cause (audit):** (1) inline JS set `data-color-scheme="dark"` from `prefers-color-scheme`; (2) two `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` CSS blocks auto-swapped tokens; (3) no `color-scheme` declared → WebView darkened native form controls.
**Fix (web standards, no hacks):** `<meta name="color-scheme" content="light">` + `color-scheme: light` on `:root` + static `data-color-scheme="light"` on `<html>`. Removed the theme script, both `@media` dark blocks, the `[data-color-scheme="dark"]` token block, and all 12 `[data-color-scheme="dark"] .x` overrides. The `[data-color-scheme="light"]` block stays the single light theme → light appearance unchanged.
**Verification:** grep-confirmed zero `prefers-color-scheme` / `data-color-scheme="dark"` / JS theme logic remain; confirmed no light rule references a now-undefined token (`--color-border-secondary`/`--button-border-secondary` had zero uses). **Code-traced only — not yet tested in a real browser/phone.** Needs a live check on iOS Safari + Android Chrome in device dark mode.
**Files changed:** `index.html`, `style.css`, `docs/DECISIONS.md` (D-013), `docs/DATA_MODEL.md`, `planning/ROADMAP.md`, `STATUS.md`.
**Branch:** `main` — on disk, not yet committed.
**Next task:** Deploy + verify on a dark-mode phone (the whole point); then the broader UX polish is parked.
**Blockers:** none.

---

## 2026-06-25 — Pipeline validation: first real feature through the full lifecycle

**Why:** Prove the *build* half end to end before trusting tonight's scheduled run (capture + triage
were already proven; build was not).
**Feature shipped:** Live recipe count on the Cook tab — `#recipe-count` shows how many recipes match
the active search/filter, updates in `renderRecipes()`. Files: `index.html` (count div), `app.js`
(set count from `filteredRecipes`), `style.css` (`.recipe-count`).
**Lifecycle exercised:** Triage (scored strong/goal #1, complexity S) → routed → promoted → Execution
→ Task Completion (FEATURES.md + DONE.md + this entry) → Commit. Capture archived to
`captures/processed/2026/06/20260625T1900Z-validation-feature.md`.
**Verification:** Code trace — count rides the existing filter render path; guarded against a missing
element; "1 recipe"/"N recipes"/"0 recipes" handled. **Not run in-browser here** — eyeball it on the
live site after deploy (Cook tab, type in search → count should change).
**Result:** Build half works end to end. Tonight's 9 PM scheduler run is now confirmation, not a first test.
**Next task:** Queue empty. Start real captures.
**Blockers:** none.

---

## 2026-06-25 — OPERATOR.md + GUIDE slimmed; triaged 2 noise captures

**Docs:** Added `OPERATOR.md` (human playbook: 7 operating principles + daily/weekly rhythm); slimmed
`GUIDE.md` to a muscle-memory capture card; registered both in `CLAUDE.md`.
**Triage:** 2 inbox captures dropped as noise — the GUIDE cheat-sheet text pasted into the bot chat,
and an empty message. Both archived to `captures/processed/2026/06/`. Inbox empty.
**Friction found:** the bot captures *everything* sent to it. Reference material (the cheat sheet)
belongs in Telegram **Saved Messages**, not the bot chat.
**Next task:** Queue empty. Start sending real `/feature`/`/bug` captures.
**Blockers:** none.

---

## 2026-06-25 — Capture pipeline live; first Triage

**Triage:** 1 capture in `captures/inbox/` (`20260625T1621Z-4-feature`, "test capture") → recognized as
a smoke-test, **dropped** (no task created), archived to `captures/processed/2026/06/`. Inbox empty.
**Pipeline status:** Telegram → n8n → `captures/inbox/` confirmed working end to end (real commit + reply).
**Next task:** Queue empty. Send a real `/feature`/`/bug` from Telegram, or promote a task into `planning/TASK.md`.
**Blockers:** none.

---

## 2026-06-25 — Mobile capture pipeline (Telegram → inbox → Triage) + repo reorg

**Task:** Build the Telegram capture system: dumb capture in n8n, smart Triage in Claude.
**Completed:**
- **Reorg:** `planning/` (ROADMAP, TASK, DONE) + `captures/` (inbox, processed). `STATUS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` stay at root.
- `planning/DONE.md` split out of ROADMAP; ROADMAP gained **Ideas** + **Research** parked buckets.
- `WORKFLOW.md`: new **Triage** event (runs first) — categorize, dedupe, **goal-score vs PROJECT.md**, route, archive to `captures/processed/YYYY/MM/`. Updated diagram, file-change table, autonomous behavior, all paths.
- `docs/PROJECT.md`: added ranked **North-star goals** for triage scoring.
- `captures/README.md`: pipeline contract + capture file format (`id` = idempotency key).
- `CLAUDE.md`, `PROMPTS.md` (P9 Triage), `run-claude.ps1` (Triage-first flow, planning/ paths, `git mv` allowed) updated.
- `n8n-telegram-inbox.json`: redesigned workflow — n8n only creates files in `captures/inbox/` (folder approach, no sha/merge race). Needs your bot token, PAT, and Telegram user id.
- DECISIONS **D-011** (capture pipeline + reorg) and **D-012** (goal-aligned triage scoring).
**Verification:** Docs/structure only — no app.js change. n8n JSON is best-effort (placeholders), **not import-tested**.
**Files changed:** `planning/*` (moved+new), `captures/*` (new), `WORKFLOW.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `PROMPTS.md`, `run-claude.ps1`, `docs/PROJECT.md`, `docs/DECISIONS.md`, `n8n-telegram-inbox.json`, `STATUS.md`.
**Branch:** `main` — on disk, not yet committed.
**Next task:** Wire n8n (token/PAT/user-id), send a test `/feature`, confirm a file lands in `captures/inbox/`, then let a run triage it. Old `n8n-telegram-github.json` can be deleted (superseded, D-011).
**Blockers:** none.

---

## 2026-06-25 — Fix: cloud data wiped on deploy/reload (signed-in users)

**Task:** Stop signed-in users' Firestore data being wiped after a push/deploy.
**Root cause:** Writes (30s auto-save, `online` event, renders) could fire before the cloud doc was
read — `loadUserData()` isn't awaited and `loadFromFirestore()` loads nothing if `navigator.onLine`
flickers false. `saveToFirestore()` uses `tx.set` (full overwrite), so a save with default/empty
`AppState` overwrote the whole cloud doc.
**Fix:** Added `AppState.cloudReady` write guard — `saveToFirestore()` no-ops until the cloud baseline
is read (`loaded`/`empty`, an `onSnapshot`, or sign-up seeding); resets on each sign-in; the `online`
handler now loads (not pushes) when not ready. Also fixed `loadFromFirestore()` omitting `cookHistory`.
**Verification:** By code trace only — no runtime/automated test harness for this path. Traced deploy
+ flaky-connection, normal load, sign-up, offline, and online-recovery scenarios; cloud is never
overwritten with un-loaded state. **Recommend a real signed-in deploy test before trusting it fully.**
**Files changed:** `app.js`, `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/DATA_MODEL.md`,
`docs/DECISIONS.md` (D-010), `ROADMAP.md` (residual `tx.set` debt), `STATUS.md`.
**Branch:** `main` — on disk, not yet committed.
**Next task:** Manually verify on the live site signed in; then consider the field-level-merge debt (ROADMAP).
**Blockers:** none.

---

## 2026-06-25 — No tasks remaining

**Task:** None — ROADMAP.md Task Queue is empty and TASK.md is NO ACTIVE TASK.
**Action:** Autonomous run stopped per WORKFLOW.md (no-active-task behavior). No work invented.
**Next task:** Add prioritized tasks to `ROADMAP.md` Task Queue, then promote the top item into `TASK.md` to activate the next run.
**Blockers:** none.

---

## 2026-06-24 — Task-driven lifecycle (WORKFLOW.md), replaces "session end"

**Task:** Redesign the dev workflow around task completion + explicit events instead of unreliable "session end".
**Completed:**
- New `WORKFLOW.md` — source of truth for the lifecycle: 6 events (Planning, Execution, Checkpoint, Task Completion, Commit, Next Task Selection), per-file change timing, and autonomous behavior for completed/partial/blocked/no-task.
- `CLAUDE.md` — replaced "Read/Update protocol (session)" with a Lifecycle pointer to WORKFLOW.md + kept the per-task read-routing table; added WORKFLOW.md to the doc map.
- `TASK.md` — added Blocker field; Current Step marked as the resume point; Done conditions reference WORKFLOW.md.
- `ROADMAP.md` — added a **Blocked** section; flow description now defers to WORKFLOW.md.
- `PROMPTS.md` — P7 reframed "Session wrap-up" → **Checkpoint**; added **P8 — Resume**.
- `run-claude.ps1` — autonomous prompt rewritten to the event model (resume → execute → completed/partial/blocked outcomes, Checkpoint on stop).
- `DECISIONS.md` — added **D-009** (task-driven lifecycle; no session end).
**Files changed:** `WORKFLOW.md` (new), `CLAUDE.md`, `TASK.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `PROMPTS.md`, `run-claude.ps1`, `docs/DECISIONS.md`, `STATUS.md`.
**Branch:** `main` — on disk, not yet committed.
**Next task:** Queue empty; promote a task into `TASK.md` to activate the next run.
**Blockers:** none.

---

## 2026-06-24 — PROMPTS.md: reusable session prompts

**Task:** Add a prompt library so task framing stays consistent across sessions.
**Completed:** New `PROMPTS.md` with P1–P7 (draft task → TASK.md, implement, fix, refactor, audit, record decision, wrap-up). Each defers to `CLAUDE.md` for rules so it can't drift. Registered in the CLAUDE.md doc map (not auto-read).
**Files changed:** `PROMPTS.md` (new), `CLAUDE.md`, `STATUS.md`.
**Branch:** `main` — on disk, not yet committed.
**Next task:** Queue empty; promote a task into `TASK.md` to activate the next run.
**Blockers:** none.

---

## 2026-06-24 — TASK.md: single active-task handoff

**Task:** Split tactical (active task) from strategic (roadmap) so the autonomous agent never picks priorities.
**Completed:**
- New `TASK.md` — the single active task (Objective / Current Step / Success Criteria / Definition of Done); idle state = NO ACTIVE TASK.
- `CLAUDE.md` read protocol now: CLAUDE → STATUS → **TASK** → only-required docs. Update protocol: on task done, promote next ROADMAP queue item into TASK.md (mechanical FIFO).
- `ROADMAP.md` is now strategic only — removed "Current Task"; the agent works `TASK.md`, not the roadmap.
- `run-claude.ps1` rewritten to the new flow (reads TASK.md, stops on NO ACTIVE TASK).
- Noted for later: `PROMPTS.md` (deferred — not built).
**Files changed:** `TASK.md` (new), `CLAUDE.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `run-claude.ps1`, `STATUS.md`.
**Branch:** `main` — on disk, not yet committed.
**Next task:** Queue empty; promote a task into `TASK.md` to activate the next autonomous run.
**Blockers:** none.

---

## 2026-06-24 — AI-first documentation system

**Task:** Redesign project docs for AI-assisted development; retire the monolithic `feature-inventory.md`.
**Completed:**
- New router `CLAUDE.md` (read/update protocol + hard rules + gotchas, folded in).
- New `docs/`: `PROJECT.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `DATA_MODEL.md`, `FEATURES.md`, `DECISIONS.md` (D-001…D-008 seeded).
- `ROADMAP.md` restructured: kept the autonomous Current Task / Queue / Done sections, added **Known Issues & Debt** (merged from KNOWN_ISSUES), kept **Do Not Work On**.
- `feature-inventory.md` content split across the above, **line numbers stripped** (stable anchors only), then deleted.
- `ROADMAP.md` + `STATUS.md` kept at **repo root** (not `/docs`) because `run-claude.ps1` reads them there by name.
**Files changed:** `CLAUDE.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `STATUS.md`, `docs/*` (new), `feature-inventory.md` (deleted).
**Branch:** `main` — on disk, not yet committed.
**Next task:** Queue is empty — add tasks to `ROADMAP.md` before the next session. Optionally commit the doc migration.
**Blockers:** none.

---

## 2026-06-24 — Autonomous overnight session — queue empty, devops housekeeping

**Tasks completed:**
1. Committed pending devops schedule changes (9PM/2AM triggers) — `DEV-OPS-GUIDE.md`, `run-claude.ps1`, `setup-task-scheduler.ps1`
2. Added `claude-session.log` to `.gitignore` to prevent it appearing as untracked every run

**Files changed:** `DEV-OPS-GUIDE.md`, `run-claude.ps1`, `setup-task-scheduler.ps1`, `.gitignore`, `STATUS.md`
**Branch:** `main` — committed and pushed.
**Next task:** No tasks in queue — add new tasks to ROADMAP.md before the next session.
**Blockers:** none

---

## 2026-06-23 — Autonomous overnight session — full ROADMAP queue completed

**Tasks completed (in order):**
1. Weekly nutrition totals in the Plan tab — `renderWeeklyNutritionTotals()` called from `renderWeeklyPlanner()`, renders into `#weekly-nutrition-totals` div
2. Grocery list alphabetical sort — `renderGroceryList()` sorts category keys A→Z with "Other" last; fallback to "Other" for missing category
3. Recipe serving scaler on recipe detail — `buildDetailIngList()` + `adjustDetailServings()` + stepper UI in collapsed detail section; resets on close
4. Pantry bulk-add mode — "Bulk add" button + `#bulk-add-modal` + `confirmBulkAdd()` with warning list for bad lines
5. Cook history log — `AppState.cookHistory` persisted to localStorage + Firestore; dashboard shows last 10 entries newest-first

## 2026-06-22 — Autonomous session — commit pending work from last session

**Task:** Commit and push all pending changes from the previous overnight session.
**Completed:** Verified all diffs against ROADMAP Done entries. All changes correct. Committed and pushed to main.
**Files changed:** `app.js`, `style.css`, `index.html`, `ROADMAP.md`, `STATUS.md`, `DEV-OPS-GUIDE.md`, `run-claude.ps1`, `setup-task-scheduler.ps1`
**Branch:** `main` — committed and pushed.
**Tests:** Code inspection; no regression risk (all additive changes).
**Next task:** No tasks remaining — queue is empty.
**Blockers:** none

## 2026-06-22 — Autonomous overnight session — full ROADMAP queue completed

**Tasks completed (in order):**
1. Mung Beans in INGREDIENT_DB — added to `app.js` with aliases, priceValue, minStockQty
2. Silent JS errors — `updateGrocerySummary()` null check added; other two bugs already fixed
3. Service worker — `sw.js` verified working; no code changes needed
4. Dead code removal — skipped (Storage Guide and `customIngredients` are actively used at 15+ call sites; removal would break the app)
5. Global error handler — `window.addEventListener('error', ...)` at end of `app.js`; `.global-error-banner` CSS in `style.css`
6. Text search in Ingredient Catalog — already implemented; added `#ingcat-no-results` element
7. "Buy it" button on cook suggestions — `buyMissingIngredient()` + button on "Missing 1" tier cards
8. Recipe favorites — `toggleFavorite()` + heart button on each card + "♥ Favorites" checkbox filter
9. Plus carried over from previous session: Password reset, Expiry suggestions, Grocery→Pantry transfer, Paste parser improvement, Filipino ingredients in LOCAL_NUTRITION_DB, Grocery list refresh on serving size change

**Files changed:** `app.js`, `style.css`, `index.html`, `ROADMAP.md`, `STATUS.md`
**Branch:** `main` — all changes on disk, NOT yet committed or pushed.
**Next task:** `git add app.js style.css index.html ROADMAP.md STATUS.md && git commit -m "feat: recipe favorites, buy-it button, global error handler, mung beans, and bug fixes" && git push origin main`
**Blockers:** none (code is done)

## 2026-06-22 — Phase C: Pantry Auto-Deduct (Session 2 — commit done)

**Task:** Commit and push the feature/pantry-auto-deduct branch
**Completed:** Verified code from previous session. Created branch `feature/pantry-auto-deduct`, committed `app.js` + `STATUS.md` (commit `8bfc950`). Push blocked by sandbox — requires manual step.
**Files changed:** `app.js` (6 lines changed), `STATUS.md` (new file committed).
**Branch:** `feature/pantry-auto-deduct` — committed locally, NOT yet pushed.
**Tests:** Criteria 1–5 verified by code inspection. Criterion 6 (Playwright) requires GitHub Actions after push.
**Next task:** Run `git push -u origin feature/pantry-auto-deduct` manually, then open a PR to main.
**Blockers:** `git push` blocked by sandbox in autonomous mode. Manual push required.

## 2026-06-22 — Phase C: Pantry Auto-Deduct

**Task:** Implement pantry auto-deduction in `markRecipeCooked()` per ROADMAP.md Phase C
**Completed:** Fixed `deductIngredientsForRecipe()` in `app.js` (lines 6432–6459). The function already existed and handled subtraction + unit conversion, but was missing the removal step when qty <= 0. Added `depleted` array to track IDs, then filter `AppState.pantry` after the loop.
**Files changed:** `app.js` — 6 lines added (~line 6432). STATUS.md — this entry.
**Branch:** Changes saved to disk but NOT committed. Session was not launched via run-claude.ps1, so git write operations were blocked (not in allowedTools). Action required: run `git checkout -b feature/pantry-auto-deduct && git add app.js STATUS.md && git commit -m "Fix: remove depleted pantry items after cooking a recipe"` manually.
**Tests:** Criteria 1–5 verified by code inspection (see ROADMAP.md). Criterion 6 (Playwright) requires GitHub Actions after push.
**Next task:** 1. Commit + push the branch. 2. Open PR to main. 3. Verify Playwright passes. 4. Merge.
**Blockers:** none (code is done, only commit step pending)

**Completed:** Created ROADMAP.md and STATUS.md. Phase C defined.
**Files changed:** ROADMAP.md (new), STATUS.md (new)
**Branch:** none (no code changes)
**Tests:** not run
**Next task:** Implement pantry auto-deduction in `markRecipeCooked()` per ROADMAP.md Phase C
**Blockers:** none

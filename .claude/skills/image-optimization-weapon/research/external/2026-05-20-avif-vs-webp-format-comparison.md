# Image Formats in 2026: When AVIF Beats WebP and When It Does Not

## Key Findings

- AVIF is 20-30% smaller than WebP at equivalent quality, especially for photographic content and gradients
- AVIF encoding is 5-10x slower than WebP, making it impractical for real-time user uploads (async encoding required)
- Browser support for AVIF is above 95% globally as of early 2026; WebP near-universal at 97-98%
- The remaining gap (older devices, legacy enterprise browsers) is why WebP fallback is still mandatory
- For curated marketing images: AVIF as primary with WebP and JPEG fallbacks
- Safari added AVIF support in 16.4 (March 2023) — the last major holdout

## Relevance to image-optimization-weapon

Directly informs `guides/01-format-selection.md` decision tree. Provides the concrete "20-30% smaller" number that the Command Brief requires for stakeholder-facing recommendations. Also confirms the encoding speed caveat that justifies async build-time AVIF conversion rather than on-the-fly for uploads.

## Direct Quotes / Data Points

- "AVIF delivers 20-30% smaller files than WebP at equivalent quality"
- "AVIF encoding is 5-10x slower than WebP"
- "Global support is above 95% as of early 2026"
- "The remaining gap is older Android devices and legacy enterprise browsers, which is why you still need a fallback"
- "Key takeaways: AVIF is 20-30% smaller than WebP at equivalent quality, especially for photographic content and images with gradients. Encoding AVIF is 5-10x slower than WebP, which makes it impractical for real-time user uploads unless you encode asynchronously."

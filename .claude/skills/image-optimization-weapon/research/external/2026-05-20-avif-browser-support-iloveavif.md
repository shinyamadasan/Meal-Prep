# AVIF Browser Support in 2026 - Complete Guide

## Summary

Comprehensive 2026 guide confirming AVIF has achieved over 95% global browser support. All major desktop and mobile browsers now support AVIF natively, with the remaining ~5% gap concentrated on older iOS versions (pre-16.4), legacy Android WebView, and Internet Explorer. The guide covers the `<picture>` element fallback chain, CSS `image-set()` background approach, CDN content negotiation, and JavaScript feature detection.

## Key quotations / statistics

- "AVIF has achieved over 95% global browser support as of 2026."
- Browser support timeline: Chrome 85 (Aug 2020), Edge 85 (Aug 2020), Firefox 93 (Oct 2021), Safari 16.4 / iOS 16.4 (Mar 2023), Samsung Internet 14 (2021)
- "The remaining ~5% of users on unsupported browsers are primarily on older iOS versions (pre-16.4), legacy Android WebView, and Internet Explorer."
- Recommended `<picture>` fallback:
  ```html
  <picture>
    <source srcset="photo.avif" type="image/avif" />
    <source srcset="photo.webp" type="image/webp" />
    <img src="photo.jpg" alt="Description" width="800" height="600" loading="lazy" />
  </picture>
  ```
- CSS background fallback uses `image-set()` with AVIF first, WebP second, JPEG third.
- "Major CDNs can handle format negotiation automatically by reading the browser's `Accept` header. Cloudflare, Fastly, AWS CloudFront, and Vercel all support this approach."

## Annotations for weapon-forge

- Directly supports `guides/01-format-selection.md` browser support matrix section.
- The `<picture>` AVIF > WebP > JPEG chain is the canonical fallback pattern to codify in the weapon.
- CDN Accept-header negotiation is the "path of least resistance" for teams already on Cloudflare/Vercel.
- JavaScript feature detection snippet is worth including in `guides/01-format-selection.md` as a progressive-enhancement note.

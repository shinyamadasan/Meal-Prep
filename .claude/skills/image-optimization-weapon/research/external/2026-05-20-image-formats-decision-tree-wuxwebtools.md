# Image Formats in 2026 - When AVIF Beats WebP

## Summary

May 2026 article providing a practical decision tree for choosing between AVIF and WebP. Covers the cases where AVIF wins (curated marketing images, hero shots, editorial photos) vs. where WebP is preferred (user-generated content, real-time encoding scenarios, legacy browser requirements). Key insight: AVIF encoding is 5-10x slower than WebP, making it impractical for real-time UGC pipelines.

## Key quotations / statistics

- "AVIF is 20-30% smaller than WebP at equivalent quality, especially for photographic content and images with gradients."
- "Encoding AVIF is 5-10x slower than WebP, which makes it impractical for real-time user uploads unless you encode asynchronously."
- "Browser support for AVIF is above 95% globally, but WebP's near-universal support makes it the safer fallback."
- "For curated marketing images, use AVIF as the primary format with WebP and JPEG fallbacks."
- "For user-generated content, stick with WebP."
- "JPEG XL is technically superior but has no viable browser support and should not be used for production websites."
- "When your data shows that AVIF is supported across all major browsers, your developers no longer need fallbacks" (from rumvision comparison -- not yet in 2026 at 95%).
- "The absolute byte savings from AVIF are small (a 10KB WebP becomes an 8KB AVIF)" for tiny thumbnails -- encoding cost may not be worth it.

## Annotations for weapon-forge

- The curated-vs-UGC distinction is a critical decision fork for `guides/01-format-selection.md`. AVIF is right for static/pre-processed images; WebP is right for real-time/on-demand pipelines.
- The 5-10x encoding speed difference supports the weapon's directive to use CDN or build-time AVIF conversion, not runtime conversion for UGC.
- The JPEG XL status corroborates filemint.dev: not production-ready, defer to AVIF+WebP in 2026.
- Small image caveat (the 10KB example) is useful nuance -- absolute savings shrink for thumbnails.

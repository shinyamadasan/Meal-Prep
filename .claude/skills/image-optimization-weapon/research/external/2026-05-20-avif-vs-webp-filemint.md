# AVIF vs WebP in 2026 - filemint.dev

## Summary

High-quality April 2026 practitioner blog comparing AVIF and WebP for production web use. Covers the format comparison table (file size, transparency, HDR, encode speed, browser support), the 2026 global coverage numbers, quality/effort settings for AVIF encoding, the JPEG XL status, and the Next.js/`<picture>` implementation patterns. Conclusion: AVIF is production-ready for most websites in 2026.

## Key quotations / statistics

- "As of April 2026, AVIF sits at roughly 93-95% global coverage on caniuse.com."
- "WebP is still slightly ahead at ~97%."
- "The gap is mostly older Android devices (Samsung Internet below v14) and iOS 15 installs still in limited circulation."
- Format comparison table:
  | Format | Typical size vs JPEG | Transparency | HDR | Encode speed | Browser support |
  |--------|---------------------|--------------|-----|--------------|-----------------|
  | WebP   | ~65-75% (~30% smaller) | Yes | No | Fast | ~97% |
  | AVIF   | ~40-60% (40-55% smaller) | Yes | Yes | Slow | ~93-95% |
  | JPEG XL | ~40-55% (45-60% smaller) | Yes | Yes | Slow | ~15% (no stable Chrome yet) |
- "AVIF is production-ready for most websites in 2026."
- "Chrome Canary 145 shipped a Rust-based JXL decoder in late 2025, reversing Google's 2022 decision to drop it. Stable Chrome support could arrive in the second half of 2026."
- AVIF quality settings: "For most web photos: quality 40-60, effort 4-6."
- Next.js config: `images: { formats: ['image/avif', 'image/webp'] }`

## Annotations for weapon-forge

- The format comparison table is the best concise source for `guides/01-format-selection.md`.
- The JPEG XL status ("not production-ready, watch in H2 2026") should go in a sidebar/callout in `guides/01-format-selection.md` -- it's a frequently asked question.
- Quality 40-60 / effort 4-6 is the Squoosh/Sharp AVIF tuning recommendation for `guides/05-tooling.md`.
- Confirms the weapon's AVIF-first, WebP-fallback stance is correct.

# Adaptive Image Loading 2026 - XICTRON

## Summary

May 2026 article synthesizing the 2026 state of adaptive image loading. Covers format-level comparisons (JPEG, WebP, AVIF bits per pixel from Web Almanac 2024), mobile bandwidth savings from srcset, `fetchpriority` browser support timeline, and a comprehensive browser support table for AVIF, WebP, `loading="lazy"`, `fetchpriority`, and `decoding="async"`.

## Key quotations / statistics

- "JPEG sits at around 2.0 bits per pixel in the median web sample, WebP at 1.3 and AVIF at 1.4 (Web Almanac 2024)."
- "WebP compresses about 25-34% better than JPEG at equivalent visual quality (Cloudinary/ShortPixel)."
- "AVIF reaches -50% versus JPEG and -20 to -30% versus WebP at comparable visual quality."
- "On smartphones this saves 70-90% of bytes versus desktop delivery (web.dev). Combined with format negotiation realistic savings of up to 75% image payload on mobile are common."
- `fetchpriority` timeline: "Support spans Chrome, Edge, Safari and Firefox (since October 2024) and is at near-universal coverage in early 2026 (MDN)."
- "Google Flights cut LCP from 2.6s to 1.9s with this hint (-700 ms), Etsy reported +4% LCP improvement, and lab tests showed up to 20-30% effect (web.dev/Chrome DevRel)."
- 2026 browser support table:
  | Feature | Chrome | Edge | Firefox | Safari | Global coverage |
  |---------|--------|------|---------|--------|-----------------|
  | AVIF | 85+ | 85+ | 93+ | 16.1+ | ~94% |
  | WebP | 23+ | 18+ | 65+ | 14+ | ~97% |
  | loading="lazy" | 77+ | 79+ | 75+ | 15.4+ | ~95% |
  | fetchpriority | 101+ | 101+ | 132+ | 17.2+ | ~93% |
  | decoding="async" | 65+ | 79+ | 63+ | 11.1+ | ~98% |
- "AVIF + WebP + JPEG fallback in picture covers nearly all relevant browsers. loading=lazy and decoding=async can be used without concern."

## Annotations for weapon-forge

- The browser support table is the most comprehensive 2026 table found in research -- perfect for `guides/00-principles.md` or `guides/01-format-selection.md`.
- The Web Almanac bits-per-pixel data grounds compression claims in measured real-world data.
- `decoding="async"` has 98% coverage -- the weapon should recommend it as a free win alongside `loading="lazy"`.
- `fetchpriority` reaching Firefox 132 (Oct 2024) means near-universal coverage; the weapon can recommend it without caveats for 2026.

# AVIF Browser Support in 2026 (filemint.dev)

## Key Findings

- **~93-95% global browser support** as of April 2026 (caniuse.com data)
- WebP is still slightly ahead at ~97%
- The gap is primarily older Android devices (Samsung Internet below v14) and iOS 15 installs
- AVIF full support milestones: Chrome 85 (Aug 2020), Firefox 93 (Oct 2021), Safari 16 (Sep 2022), Edge 121 (Jan 2024)
- AVIF declared "Baseline 2024" — all major browsers supported since January 26, 2024
- JXL (JPEG XL) sits at roughly 14-15% in 2026 (Safari 17+ only) — not production-ready

## Relevance to image-optimization-weapon

This is the primary data point for the Command Brief's "AVIF is the 2026 default" directive. The ~93-95% coverage number supports the claim that AVIF is production-ready with a `<picture>` fallback, and directly informs `guides/01-format-selection.md`.

## Direct Quotes / Data Points

- "As of April 2026, AVIF sits at roughly 93–95% global coverage on caniuse.com. WebP is still slightly ahead at ~97%."
- "AVIF is production-ready for most websites in 2026. The compression wins are real and the browser coverage is high enough that a proper picture element fallback covers everyone."
- Compression comparison: `AVIF: ~40–60% smaller than JPEG at equivalent quality`

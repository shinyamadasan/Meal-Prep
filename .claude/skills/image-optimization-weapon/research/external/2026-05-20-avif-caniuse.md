## Annotations for weapon-forge

- This is the primary citation for the browser support matrix table in `guides/01-format-selection.md`.
- Key nuance: Edge didn't get full support until version 121 (late 2023/early 2024), so the "full support since January 2024" date in other sources refers to Edge 121 crossing the Baseline threshold.
- Opera Mini and KaiOS are genuine gaps. For global-audience sites these may be worth a fallback.
- The "AVIF vs JPEG XL" note is relevant for `guides/01-format-selection.md` -- include JPEG XL as "watch this space, not production-ready in 2026."

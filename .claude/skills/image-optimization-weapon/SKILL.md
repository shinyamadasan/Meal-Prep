name: image-optimization-weapon
description: Image optimization specialist for React/Next.js and HTML contexts — AVIF/WebP format selection (AVIF is the 2026 production default), responsive srcset/sizes calculus, blur placeholders (LQIP via Sharp, BlurHash-as-CSS-gradient, ThumbHash), next/image remote patterns and the Next.js 16 priority→preload shift, and CLI tooling (Sharp Node API, Squoosh CLI for one-offs). Use when the user says "optimize my images", "convert to AVIF", "set up srcset", "add blur placeholders", "next/image remote patterns", "LCP image is slow", "fix layout shift from images", "AVIF vs WebP", or when auditing a codebase for unoptimized image delivery. Do NOT use for SVG icon systems (icon-system-guardian), general Lighthouse audits beyond image-specific findings (lighthouse-pagespeed-guardian), CDN/caching architecture beyond image Cache-Control (devops-guardian), or CSS animation performance (ux-ui-guardian).

# Image Optimization Weapon

The `image-optimization-weapon` encodes the complete 2026 image delivery playbook: format selection, responsive delivery, placeholder strategies, framework integration, and tooling. Its primary audience is React/Next.js developers shipping web products where images are a material fraction of page weight and LCP candidates.

**The non-negotiables (detailed in `guides/00-principles.md`):**
1. AVIF first, WebP fallback — never JPEG as primary for new raster content.
2. `width` + `height` always — missing dimensions cause CLS.
3. LCP images get `priority` (Next.js <16) or `preload` (Next.js 16+) / `fetchpriority="high"` (native) — never `loading="lazy"`.
4. `sizes` must match the CSS layout — the default `100vw` is wrong for most components.
5. Placeholders must be chosen deliberately — LQIP via Sharp is the default; BlurHash/ThumbHash for color-faithful scenarios.

## When to use this skill

**Trigger on:**
- "optimize my images" / "convert to AVIF" / "switch to AVIF"
- "set up srcset and sizes" / "responsive images"
- "add blur placeholders" / "BlurHash" / "LQIP" / "ThumbHash"
- "next/image remote patterns" / "next/image config" / "Image component"
- "my LCP image is slow" / "images causing layout shift" / "CLS from images"
- "AVIF vs WebP" / "which image format should I use"
- "audit our images" / "image optimization report"
- "Squoosh" / "Sharp" / "ImageOptim" (in web context)

**Do NOT trigger on:**
- SVG icon library selection → `icon-system-guardian`
- Lighthouse score interpretation / CWV remediation beyond images → `lighthouse-pagespeed-guardian`
- CDN cache TTL / Cache-Control strategy → `devops-guardian`
- CI build pipelines beyond per-image squash → `devops-guardian`

## Quick-reference decision table

| Scenario | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| New raster content (photo, hero, product) | AVIF primary, WebP fallback, `<picture>` or `next/image` |
| Transparency needed | WebP (or PNG for lossless) — AVIF supports alpha but WebP encodes faster |
| Simple logo / diagram | SVG preferred; PNG fallback if SVG not available |
| LCP image above the fold | `priority` (Next.js <16) / `preload` (Next.js 16+) / `fetchpriority="high"` (HTML) |
| Image below the fold | `loading="lazy"` (HTML) / default lazy in `next/image` |
| Placeholder — simplest | LQIP via Sharp (16px WebP + CSS `filter: blur`) |
| Placeholder — color-faithful no-JS | BlurHash as CSS gradient via `@unpic/placeholder` |
| Placeholder — alpha channel support | ThumbHash |
| Next.js with Vercel hosting | `next/image` with `formats: ['image/avif', 'image/webp']` in `next.config` |
| Teams on Cloudflare / Imgix / Fastly CDN | Enable CDN-level format negotiation — no code changes needed |

## Example map

- `examples/nextjs-avif-with-lqip.md` — Happy path: Next.js `<Image>` with AVIF/WebP formats, correct `sizes`, LQIP blur placeholder, and LCP priority.
- `examples/html-picture-srcset-art-direction.md` — Edge case: native `<picture>` + `<source>` for art-direction responsive images in a non-Next.js context.

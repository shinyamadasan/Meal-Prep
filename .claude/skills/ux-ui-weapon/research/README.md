Raw research notes and the version audit for this Weapon. Every factual claim in `guides/` should trace back to a note here.

## Refresh cadence

Re-run the research pass when:

- Any library in `library-versions.md` ships a major version bump.
- A new library is added to the reference set in the Command Brief.
- A user-reported issue traces to outdated guidance in a guide.

Always write the new research note first (dated), *then* update the guide.

## Open questions

Scoped from the brief's IDEAS/QUESTIONS section:

- Product-specific non-negotiables — resolved: live inside the deploying product's `library/knowledge-base/<product>-ux-ui/` folder, not in this generic Weapon.
- TanStack Query / React Hook Form — out of scope for this Weapon; handled by `react-guardian`.
- Token drift scanner — noted as future enhancement in `guides/10-common-violations.md`; not built in this pass.
- System-specific starter kit — encoded inline as "open the folder first" principle; product-specific detail accrues in the design system folder, not this Weapon.

## Deliverables

- One dated research note per mandatory library/spec (target: 6–10 notes).
- `research/library-versions.md` pinning the version reviewed.
- `research/gaps.md` for any tool/source unavailable at forge time.

## Stop criterion

Research stops when each rule in every guide can point to a file in `research/` or a section of the Command Brief.

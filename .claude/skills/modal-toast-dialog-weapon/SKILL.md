name: modal-toast-dialog-weapon
description: Accessible overlay specialist for React — primitive selection (Radix Dialog, AlertDialog, Vaul Drawer, Sonner toast, cmdk command menu, Headless UI), the six-point accessible-modal contract (focus trap, escape, scroll lock, aria-modal, aria-labelledby, focus return), and the four-tier toast-vs-notification taxonomy. Use when choosing an overlay primitive, debugging focus trap regressions, implementing a drawer/sheet, wiring Sonner toasts into a React app, building a command palette, or auditing overlay stacking behavior. Paired with `modal-toast-dialog-guardian`.

# modal-toast-dialog Weapon

Procedural arsenal for `modal-toast-dialog-guardian`. Encodes the canonical primitive selection matrix, the six-point accessible-modal contract, the four-tier toast-vs-notification taxonomy, and per-primitive implementation patterns for the 2026 React ecosystem.

---

## When this weapon applies

Load when `modal-toast-dialog-guardian` is invoked. Typical triggers:

- "Which primitive should I use for this dialog?"
- "My focus trap isn't working"
- "Should this be a toast or a dialog?"
- "How do I set up Sonner in Next.js App Router?"
- "The drawer isn't scrolling inside"
- "Build me a command palette"
- "Audit our overlay accessibility"

Do NOT load for:
- Design token or animation decisions (ux-ui-guardian owns those)
- General React component architecture (react-guardian)
- Overlays that gate auth flows (auth-guardian)
- Security audit of overlays protecting sensitive actions (security-guardian)

---

## First action when this weapon is loaded

1. Read `guides/00-primitive-selection-matrix.md` — pick the right primitive first.
2. Read `guides/01-accessible-modal-contract.md` — every overlay must pass the six-point contract.
3. Read the per-primitive guide relevant to the request (02 through 05).
4. Use `templates/overlay-audit-report.md` to structure any output report.

## Primitive selection matrix (summary)

| Need | Canonical primitive |
|---|---|
| General content modal | Radix `Dialog` |
| Destructive confirmation | Radix `AlertDialog` |
| Bottom / side sheet, snap points | `Vaul` Drawer |
| Ephemeral feedback (success, error, info) | `Sonner` `toast()` |
| Command palette / search menu | `cmdk` `Command` (or `CommandDialog`) |
| Non-Radix React projects | Headless UI `Dialog` |

See `guides/00-primitive-selection-matrix.md` for the full decision table with edge cases.

---

## The six-point accessible-modal contract

Every overlay produced by this weapon must satisfy:

1. `aria-modal="true"` on the dialog container.
2. Correct `role` — `"dialog"` for content overlays, `"alertdialog"` for destructive confirmations.
3. **Focus trap** — Tab/Shift+Tab cycles within the overlay only. Never hand-roll; use the primitive's built-in trap.
4. **Escape key** — closes the dialog (AlertDialog may disable Escape for truly irreversible actions).
5. **Scroll lock** — `overflow: hidden` on `<body>` while the overlay is open.
6. **Focus return** — focus returns to the trigger element when the overlay closes.

See `guides/01-accessible-modal-contract.md` for implementation details and WCAG 2.2 additions.

## Toast-vs-notification taxonomy (summary)

| Scenario | Pattern | Primitive |
|---|---|---|
| Ephemeral feedback (save, delete, copy) | Toast — auto-dismiss | Sonner `toast()` |
| Destructive confirmation | Alert dialog | Radix `AlertDialog` |
| Error that requires user attention | Persistent toast | `toast.error()` with `duration: Infinity` |
| Side panel / filter tray | Drawer | Vaul |
| Ambient activity feed | Notification center | Custom tray (out of scope) |

See `guides/02-toast-notification-taxonomy.md` for the full decision tree and anti-patterns.

## Critical directives

- **Mount overlays in a portal outside the app root.** Overlays inside scroll containers or stacking contexts produce z-index and scroll-lock failures. See `guides/03-stacking-and-layering.md`.
- **Never re-implement the focus trap.** All known hand-rolled traps fail on Shadow DOM, iframes, or dynamically rendered content. Use the primitive's built-in implementation.
- **Apply the taxonomy before recommending a primitive.** Ephemeral toasts masking destructive confirmations are a critical UX failure.
- **Validate focus return on close.** The most common overlay accessibility regression.
- **Vaul requires `"use client"`.** In Next.js App Router, all Vaul components must be in a client module.

# Guide 03 — Stacking and Layering

Overlays from different primitives coexist in the same DOM. This guide covers the z-index strategy, portal coexistence, and nested overlay patterns.

*Derives from: `research/external/radix-dialog.md`, `research/external/vaul-drawer.md`, `research/external/sonner-toast.md`.*

## Portal targets

All three primitives mount to `document.body` by default:

| Primitive | Portal target | Default z-index |
|---|---|---|
| Radix Dialog | `document.body` | ~50 (controlled by CSS variables) |
| Vaul Drawer | `document.body` | ~50 |
| Sonner `<Toaster>` | `document.body` | 9999 |
| cmdk `CommandDialog` | `document.body` (via Radix Dialog) | ~50 |

Sonner deliberately uses a high z-index so toasts appear above all modals. This is intentional; do not lower it unless a full-screen overlay (lightbox, video player) should cover toasts.

## Z-index strategy for a stacked UI

Use a layered z-index scale:

```css
:root {
  --z-dropdown: 100;
  --z-sticky: 200;
  --z-modal: 300;
  --z-drawer: 300;
  --z-toast: 400;
  --z-tooltip: 500;
}
```

Apply via Tailwind JIT or CSS variables on the primitive's overlay/content element.

Radix provides CSS custom properties (`--radix-dialog-content-z-index`) that can be overridden per-instance.

## Dialog on top of a Drawer

The correct pattern: mount the Radix Dialog's portal with a higher z-index than the Vaul Drawer.

```tsx
// Vaul Drawer (z-index: 300 via CSS)
<Drawer.Root>
  <Drawer.Portal>
    <Drawer.Content className="z-[300]">
      {/* Trigger a Dialog from inside the Drawer */}
      <ConfirmDeleteDialog />
    </Drawer.Content>
  </Drawer.Portal>
</Drawer.Root>

// ConfirmDeleteDialog (z-index: 350 to sit above the Drawer)
<AlertDialog.Root>
  <AlertDialog.Portal>
    <AlertDialog.Overlay className="z-[340]" />
    <AlertDialog.Content className="z-[350]">
      ...
    </AlertDialog.Content>
  </AlertDialog.Portal>
</AlertDialog.Root>
```

Both portals mount to `document.body`, so z-index comparison works correctly between them.

## Scroll lock coexistence

When a Dialog opens inside a Vaul Drawer:
1. Vaul has already applied scroll lock to `<body>`.
2. Radix Dialog applies its own scroll lock on top.
3. When the Dialog closes, Radix removes its lock — but Vaul's lock should persist until the Drawer closes.

In practice, both Radix and Vaul use the same underlying `@radix-ui/react-remove-scroll` mechanism, which reference-counts the lock. This means the lock is correctly maintained until both are closed.

**Verify:** open a Dialog inside a Drawer, close the Dialog, confirm the body is still scroll-locked (Drawer is still open), close the Drawer, confirm body scroll is restored.

---

## Sonner + Radix coexistence

No special configuration needed. Sonner's `<Toaster>` and Radix Dialog portals are independent. Sonner's default `z-index: 9999` ensures toasts appear above Radix modals.

One gotcha: if you add `pointer-events: none` to a full-screen overlay, ensure the `<Toaster>` is outside that overlay's stacking context, or add `pointer-events: auto` specifically to the `<Toaster>`.

---

## Background content inert

When a modal opens, background content should be non-interactive. Radix achieves this via `aria-hidden="true"` on the app root when a Dialog is open. Verify:

```tsx
// app root should receive aria-hidden="true" when dialog opens
document.getElementById('__next') // or '#root', '#app'
// should have aria-hidden="true" in DevTools when Dialog is open
```

Vaul does the same. Sonner does NOT inert background content (toasts are supplemental, not modal).

## Failure-mode check-list

Walk `guides/11-common-failure-modes.md`. Mark each `pass` / `fail` / `n/a` / `flag-to-security`.

### OAuth-specific

- [ ] Session fixation: `pass` / `fail` / `n/a`
- [ ] OAuth callback CSRF (`state` validation): `pass` / `fail`
- [ ] Redirect URI confusion: `pass` / `fail`
- [ ] Token leakage in URL fragments (no implicit flow): `pass` / `fail`
- [ ] ID-token signature verified: `pass` / `fail`
- [ ] `aud` claim validated: `pass` / `fail`
- [ ] `nonce` used and validated: `pass` / `fail`
- [ ] Refresh-token rotation: `pass` / `fail` / `n/a`

### Session

- [ ] `HttpOnly` on session cookie: `pass` / `fail`
- [ ] `Secure` on session cookie: `pass` / `fail`
- [ ] `SameSite` set (Lax / Strict / None+CSRF): `pass` / `fail`
- [ ] Opaque session OR JWT with revocation: `pass` / `fail`
- [ ] Logout server-side revocation: `pass` / `fail`
- [ ] Session ID regeneration at sign-in: `pass` / `fail`

### Authorization

- [ ] Two-layer enforcement on tenant resources: `pass` / `fail`
- [ ] Role-revocation latency acceptable: `pass` / `fail`
- [ ] Cross-tenant test coverage: `pass` / `fail`

### MFA

- [ ] MFA recovery codes issued at enrollment: `pass` / `fail` / `n/a`
- [ ] Recovery flow MFA-protected: `pass` / `fail` / `n/a`
- [ ] TOTP secret encrypted at rest: `pass` / `fail` / `n/a`
- [ ] Magic link single-use: `pass` / `fail` / `n/a`
- [ ] SMS as recovery only: `pass` / `fail` / `n/a`

### Configuration

- [ ] `state` and `nonce` cryptographically random: `pass` / `fail`
- [ ] No `http://` redirect URIs in production: `pass` / `fail`
- [ ] No wildcard redirect URIs: `pass` / `fail`
- [ ] No `service_role` / superuser keys in client bundle: `pass` / `fail`
- [ ] Google client unused-deletion defense (synthetic call + runbook): `pass` / `fail` / `n/a`

### Process

- [ ] Audit log on auth events: `pass` / `fail`
- [ ] Email-domain allowlist enforced (if applicable): `pass` / `fail` / `n/a`
- [ ] `link_account` events logged + user-notified: `pass` / `fail` / `n/a`

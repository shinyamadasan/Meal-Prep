## Two-layer enforcement plan

For every row above, name where it's enforced:

| Permission | Middleware check | Data-layer check (RLS or query filter) |
|---|---|---|
| `tenant:delete` | `requireRole('owner')` on `DELETE /tenants/:id` | RLS: `auth.uid() = tenants.owner_id` |
| `posts:read` | `requireSession()` | RLS: `tenant_id IN (user's tenants)` |
| `posts:write` | `requireRole('owner','admin','editor')` | RLS: same + role check on insert / update |
| _____ | _____ | _____ |

## Multi-tenancy strategy

- [ ] Shared schema, `tenant_id` column on every table
- [ ] Schema-per-tenant
- [ ] Database-per-tenant

If shared schema: confirm RLS on every shared table. Hand to `db-guardian`.

## Cross-tenant test plan

Test cases to add:

- [ ] User A in tenant X cannot read posts from tenant Y (HTTP 403 or empty result, not 200 with data)
- [ ] User A in tenant X cannot mutate posts in tenant Y
- [ ] Demoting an admin removes admin permissions within `_____` seconds
- [ ] Removing a member from a tenant immediately invalidates their access

## Audit handoff

Hand the filled table to `security-guardian` along with the migration that implements the RLS policies (which `db-guardian` writes).

## Summary

Authorization is consistently the most common production-impacting security failure (OWASP A01). The dominant fix pattern in 2026 is **two-layer enforcement**: middleware AND data layer (or RLS at the DB). Single-layer enforcement is a finding regardless of how careful the middleware is.

## Vocabulary

- **Role** — bundle of permissions.
- **Permission** — verb on a resource.
- **Tenant / org** — multi-customer boundary.
- **ABAC** — policy logic over attributes (region, clearance, ownership).
- **RLS** — Postgres row-level security; DB enforces.

## Two-layer enforcement (mandatory)

**Layer 1: middleware / edge.** Session check; role check at route level.

**Layer 2: data layer.** Query filters by tenant or owner. RLS at DB enforces it from below. Single-layer is a single point of failure.

Why both:

- Middleware can be bypassed (sibling internal call, misconfigured proxy, forgotten on a new route).
- Data-layer-only leaks side-channel (403 vs 404 timing).

## Multi-tenancy patterns

- **Shared schema, `tenant_id` column** — most common. RLS or query filter required.
- **Schema-per-tenant** — operational cost; helps with strict isolation.
- **Database-per-tenant** — for compliance-bound large customers.

## Policy library options

- **Cerbos** — declarative policies, gRPC service.
- **Oso** — embedded library, declarative.
- **OPA** (Open Policy Agent) — general-purpose, Rego language.
- **Casbin** — ABAC / RBAC / ACL — multi-language.

For most apps, plain RBAC with two-layer enforcement is sufficient. Reach for a policy library when permissions vary per row, per attribute, or per customer-defined rule.

## Common failures

- Single-layer enforcement (middleware-only or data-layer-only).
- Stale role on JWT (user demoted, JWT still valid).
- Email-as-key (emails change).
- No cross-tenant negative test coverage.

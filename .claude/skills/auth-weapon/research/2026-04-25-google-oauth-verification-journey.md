## Summary

Google's OAuth verification process for sensitive and restricted scopes is multi-week minimum. Real-world reports describe 2–6 weeks for sensitive scopes, 3–6 months for restricted with CASA. Reviewer feedback iterates; demos and privacy policies often need rework.

## What gets reviewed

- Brand consistency (consent screen ↔ app ↔ marketing).
- Domain ownership (Search Console).
- Privacy policy: explicit mention of Google data, retention, sharing.
- Per-scope justification.
- Demo video showing each scope's data being used in-app, with full URL bar visible.
- For restricted: CASA assessment by Google-approved third-party assessor (annual).

## Common failures (real-world)

- Demo video missing scope coverage — e.g., `gmail.readonly` requested, video doesn't show Gmail data being read.
- Privacy policy too generic — doesn't enumerate Google data types.
- Logo with text or transparency — re-submission required.
- Domain not verified or DNS lag.
- Scope-creep across multiple submissions — each new scope re-triggers review.

## Cost

- CASA assessor cost: USD $5k–$75k+ depending on scope of assessment. Annual.
- Internal cost: ~40–80 engineer hours per cycle, often including a UX revision and a security re-architecture.

## Why this matters

- Plan launch dates around verification timeline, not the other way.
- Bundle scopes once if possible; re-verification on incremental scope adds is expensive.
- Sensitive vs restricted matters — `gmail.readonly` (sensitive) is far cheaper than `gmail.modify` (restricted).

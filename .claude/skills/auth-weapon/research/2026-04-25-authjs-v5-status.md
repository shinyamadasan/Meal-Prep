## Summary

Auth.js v5 (formerly NextAuth.js v5) has stabilized. It remains the largest-ecosystem OSS auth library for Next.js with 50+ provider configurations. The v4 → v5 migration is real but well-documented.

## What changed in v5

- Single `auth.ts` file replaces inline config in `[...nextauth]/route.ts`.
- `getServerSession()` → `auth()`.
- Middleware: `export { auth as middleware }`.
- Env var: `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` → `AUTH_SECRET`.
- `AUTH_TRUST_HOST` required behind reverse proxies.
- Provider configs reshaped (e.g., scope on `Google`).
- Adapter API updated; check version compatibility per adapter.

## Default-strategy debate

Auth.js docs lean toward `session: { strategy: 'jwt' }` as default. This is widely critiqued — JWT-only sessions force a choice between long TTLs (security risk) and short TTLs (UX cost) with no graceful logout-everywhere. For most apps, `database` strategy is the better default.

## Auth.js vs Better Auth (2026)

- Auth.js: mature, larger provider matrix, larger community.
- Better Auth: cleaner DX, cohesive plugin model, hot in 2026.
- For a new project on Next.js, Better Auth is the slightly stronger pick for the team that wants minimal config; Auth.js still reasonable when an obscure IdP needs to be supported.

# Research Plan — github-repo-health-weapon

## Depth tier: normal

Normal depth: 10-20 primary sources, 6-month recency window, covers official docs + canonical blog posts + community best-practice guides. Does not require exhaustive literature review (that is `deep` tier).

## Query plan

1. "GitHub repository health audit checklist 2026" — finds current community checklists and scoring frameworks
2. "Branch protection rulesets required reviewers status checks 2026" — covers the 2025 Rulesets GA and 2026 best practice floor
3. "CODEOWNERS patterns monorepo polyrepo 2026" — covers directory ownership patterns, syntax edge cases, team vs. individual ownership
4. "Conventional commits semantic-release automation 2026" — covers commit format scoring, semantic-release compatibility, squash discipline
5. "GitHub issue PR template best practices 2026" — covers template structure, required fields, community health files

## Sources targeted

- GitHub Docs (official, authoritative)
- GitHub Engineering Blog (canonical for new feature rollouts like Rulesets GA)
- Conventional Commits specification (v1.0.0, stable)
- GitHub CLI docs (gh api, gh repo commands)
- GitHub Actions marketplace guides for required status checks
- semantic-release documentation (commit format automation)
- Community: github/gitignore (canonical .gitignore templates)

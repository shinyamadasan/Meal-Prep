## Summary

Many of the PRs `quality-guardian` audits will arrive without comprehensive tests — especially early-stage features and AI-authored implementations. The literature identifies three fallback strategies when existing test coverage doesn't cover the changed paths:

1. **Dependency impact analysis** — trace which modules import the changed file and flag their exported surface area as "at-risk."
2. **Canary/synthetic monitoring** — staged rollout with live metrics (not a tool the Angel can invoke, but a recommendation it should make).
3. **Static analysis and type-checking** — strict TypeScript, linting, and dependency graphs catch a class of regressions without runtime tests.

For a review-time Angel, #1 and #3 are the actionable ones.

## Dependency-based "at-risk surface" check (Angel-usable)

When the plan says "modify function `X`":

1. Grep the repo for imports of `X`. Every caller is a potential regression site.
2. Check whether `X`'s signature, return shape, thrown errors, or side-effects changed.
3. Any caller not updated to match the new contract is a regression.

This is the core heuristic for the Detrimental Patterns → "regression" sub-axis when tests are absent.

## Key quotations

> "Modern platforms use AI-driven impact analysis to predict test relevance based on code changes, dependency graphs, and historical failure patterns."

> "Organizations lacking comprehensive test coverage are increasingly turning to monitoring production behavior, AI-driven risk analysis, and synthetic testing rather than relying solely on pre-deployment test execution."

## Relevance to this weapon

Source for the "regression detection" portion of `guides/04-five-axis-evaluation.md` (Detrimental Patterns axis) and `guides/07-common-gaps.md`. The Angel cannot run tests — it reviews statically. But it can and should:

- Grep for every caller of a modified function/export.
- Compare old and new signatures in the diff.
- Flag any caller not visited in the diff that relies on the old contract as a Warning at minimum, Critical if the behavior change is silent (e.g., return type changed from `Promise<User>` to `Promise<User | null>` with no caller checking null).

When there are zero tests for a modified area and the plan said "add tests," that's a Gap finding. When the plan said nothing about tests and there are no tests, it's a Suggestion — not a Warning. The plan is the contract.

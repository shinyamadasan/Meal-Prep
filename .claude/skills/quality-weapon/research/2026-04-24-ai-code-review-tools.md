## Summary

Several mature AI PR-review tools exist (CodeRabbit, Cursor BugBot, Graphite Diamond, Greptile, Qodo). Studying their output shapes establishes what consumers now expect from an autonomous code reviewer. `quality-guardian` is an in-IDE subagent, but the report format should be consistent with what these tools produce so PR authors can read findings in a familiar structure.

## Common output elements across tools

Looking at CodeRabbit, BugBot, Graphite Diamond, and Greptile review outputs, the shared elements are:

1. **Summary** at the top: 1–3 sentences on overall verdict.
2. **Severity-tagged findings** — each finding carries a level (Critical / High / Medium / Low or emoji-tagged equivalent).
3. **File:line coordinates** — every finding cites `file.ts:LN` or `file.ts:LN-LN`.
4. **Proposed fix or code suggestion** — often inline with a unified diff.
5. **Category tags** — bug, performance, security, style, test, etc.
6. **Summary of files changed** — a walk through the PR's files.

## Key observations

> "CodeRabbit supports pull request integration, CLI and in-IDE reviews, and is one of the most widely adopted AI review apps on GitHub/GitLab, with over 2 million repositories connected and 13 million PRs reviewed."

> "Bugbot [is] an AI code review agent deeply embedded in the Cursor development environment, designed to operate as a seamless extension of the developer workflow rather than a separate external tool."

> Autonomous tools like Macroscope "[aim] to take review off engineers' plates entirely rather than just helping them do it faster."

## Differences from `quality-guardian`'s scope

These tools are **plan-agnostic** — they review the diff against general-purpose heuristics (best practices, bug patterns, security). `quality-guardian` is **plan-relative** — it reviews the diff against a specific PRD document. The distinction matters:

- CodeRabbit will not know whether a feature was in scope for the PR; `quality-guardian` will, because it reads the plan.
- CodeRabbit flags generic bug patterns; `quality-guardian` additionally flags "the plan said X but the code does Y" — a class of finding these tools cannot produce.
- `quality-guardian` must produce a **traceability table** mapping every plan requirement to its implementation or to a gap, which no generic AI reviewer emits.

## Relevance to this weapon

This shapes `templates/qa-report.md`. Adopt the industry norm of severity-tagged findings with file:line coordinates, but add the plan-traceability table and the five-axis scorecard — those are the Angel's unique contribution. Also confirms the Command Brief's decision to produce a markdown report (not JSON, not a PR comment thread): markdown is the lingua franca of these tools and of GitHub/Cursor UI.

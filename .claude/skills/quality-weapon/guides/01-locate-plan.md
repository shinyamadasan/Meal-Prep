# 01 — Locate the Plan Document

The plan is the ground truth for the audit. Without a plan, there is no audit.

---

## Resolution order

Try each source in order. Stop at the first that yields a plan.

### 1. Explicit pointer from the invoker

If the user's message includes a path (e.g., "QA `library/requirements/features/feature-007-billing/prd-feature-007-billing.md`"), use that file directly. Do not second-guess the choice. Verify the file exists and is readable.

### 2. Attached context

If the Cursor session has attached files or the message references a file that was just edited (like a PRD file), inspect those. A plan is typically the longest markdown document in the session that contains sections like "User Stories", "Acceptance Criteria", "Scope", or "Non-Goals".

### 3. `library/requirements/` directory

Scan the repo for plan documents in their canonical location. Typical patterns:

```bash
ls -la library/requirements/features/ 2>/dev/null
ls -la library/requirements/issues/ 2>/dev/null
find library/requirements/features -maxdepth 2 -name "feature-*.md" -type f 2>/dev/null
find library/requirements/issues -maxdepth 2 -name "issue-*.md" -type f 2>/dev/null
```

Canonical convention used by `library-guardian`:

- Features: `library/requirements/features/feature-<###>-<title>/prd-feature-<###>-<title>.md` (or `prd-feature-<###>-<title>-ck-<clickupId>.md` when sourced from ClickUp). Completed feature folders move to `library/requirements/features/completed/`.
- Issues: `library/requirements/issues/issue-<###>-<title>/ird-issue-<###>-<title>.md`.

Older repos that have not yet adopted this convention may keep plans in `docs/prd/`, `docs/plans/`, `tasks/`, `.specify/specs/`, or a root-level `SPEC.md`. Accept any of these and flag the drift to `library-guardian` separately.

### 4. Branch correlation

If the branch name encodes a plan reference (e.g., `feat/phase-3-billing`), search for plans whose filename or header matches:

```bash
git branch --show-current           # get current branch
# then grep tasks/ for files whose name or heading matches
```

### 5. Last-modified PRD in git log

If nothing else works, look for the most recently modified plan-like file in git log:

```bash
git log --oneline --all -- 'library/requirements/features/**/feature-*.md' | head -20
git log --oneline --all -- 'library/requirements/issues/**/issue-*.md' | head -20
```

### 6. Ask the invoker

If no plan can be located after the above, stop and ask. Do not fabricate a plan from the diff. Example prompt:

> "I couldn't locate the plan document. Is it in `library/requirements/features/`, `library/requirements/issues/`, or somewhere else? If you don't have one, I need at least a short spec — the audit depends on comparing the implementation against stated requirements."

---

## Validate the plan before proceeding

Once you have a candidate plan:

1. It should contain at least one of: Goals, User Stories, Requirements, Acceptance Criteria, Non-Goals, Scope.
2. It should reference the feature/phase matching the branch or the user's request.
3. It should not itself be a QA report from a previous run (check for scorecards and "Critical Issues" sections — those mean you grabbed the wrong file).

If the candidate fails validation, escalate back to resolution step 3 or 6.

---

## Handling multi-plan situations

If the diff spans multiple plans (e.g., bug fixes from Plan A interleaved with feature work from Plan B):

- Produce **one report per plan**, each in that plan's own `reports/` subfolder as `<date>-qa-report.md` (or in `library/qa/<domain>/` for standalone audits).
- Each report's "Files Changed" section lists only files relevant to that plan.
- Note in each Summary that the audit was scoped to one plan and point at the sibling report.

Do not try to merge two plans into a single audit. The traceability table requires a single source of truth per report.

---

## Handling a missing plan that the invoker can't produce

If the user says "there's no plan, just audit what's there":

- This is not a plan audit. Decline politely and recommend either:
  - Having `library-guardian` author a backwards-PRD from the diff first, then running QA against it, or
  - Running a plan-agnostic code review (which is not this Angel's job — suggest the `review` skill or a generic AI code reviewer like CodeRabbit).

Do not produce a report anyway. The value of the audit is the plan comparison.

# 06 — Report Writing

How to produce the findings-report markdown. Use `templates/qa-report.md` as the skeleton and fill each section in order.

---

## File name and location

Pick the path that matches the source plan. Reports are dated, so multiple audits can coexist without overwriting.

- **Feature PRD audit:** `library/requirements/features/feature-<###>-<title>/reports/<YYYY-MM-DD>-qa-report.md`
- **Issue IRD audit:** `library/requirements/issues/issue-<###>-<title>/reports/<YYYY-MM-DD>-qa-report.md`
- **Standalone audit (no source plan):** `library/qa/<domain>/<YYYY-MM-DD>-qa-report.md`

Examples:

- Plan `library/requirements/features/feature-007-billing/prd-feature-007-billing.md` → report at `library/requirements/features/feature-007-billing/reports/2026-04-26-qa-report.md`.
- Plan `library/requirements/issues/issue-042-stale-cache/ird-issue-042-stale-cache.md` → report at `library/requirements/issues/issue-042-stale-cache/reports/2026-04-26-qa-report.md`.
- Standalone audit of the auth surface → `library/qa/auth/2026-04-26-qa-report.md`.

If two audits run on the same date, suffix the second one with a slug (e.g., `2026-04-26-qa-report-post-security-fixes.md`) rather than overwriting.

Create the `reports/` subfolder (or `library/qa/<domain>/`) if it does not exist.

## Writing each section

### Summary (2–3 sentences)

Open with the verdict, then the headline findings, then the recommendation. Voice: calm, factual, no hedging.

Good:

> The phase-3 billing implementation is largely complete with one Critical gap (missing retry on failed invoices, US-3) and three Warnings. Recommend addressing the retry logic before merge; the Warnings can be deferred to a follow-up.

Bad:

> Overall the PR seems to be in good shape! There are a few things to look at but nothing too serious. I think maybe the retry stuff should be revisited.

### Scorecard

A five-row table, one row per axis. Use ✅ / ⚠️ / ❌ exclusively — no yellow-light ambiguity.

```markdown
| Category       | Status | Notes |
|---------------|--------|-------|
| Completeness  | ⚠️ | 1 of 7 plan items missing (US-3 retry logic) |
| Correctness   | ✅ | Implementations match plan behavior |
| Alignment     | ✅ | Naming and structure match `library/requirements/features/feature-007-billing/prd-feature-007-billing.md` |
| Gaps          | ⚠️ | Missing empty-state for invoice list; no loading.tsx |
| Detrimental   | ⚠️ | N+1 in `invoice-service.ts:listInvoices` |
```

### Findings sections

Three sections in this order: Critical, Warnings, Suggestions. Each is a checkbox list so PR authors can tick items as they fix.

Each finding follows this shape:

```markdown
- [ ] **<one-line title>** — `path/to/file.ts:LN-LN`

  <2–4 sentences explaining what's wrong, why it matters, and a suggested remediation.>

  ```ts
  <1–6 lines of offending or missing code>
  ```
```

Example:

```markdown
- [ ] **Missing retry on failed invoice (US-3)** — `src/billing/invoice-service.ts:88-104`

  The plan §3.3 specifies that a failed invoice (Stripe `payment_failed`) must trigger a retry with exponential backoff. The current handler logs the failure and returns — no retry is scheduled. This leaves the user in a "payment failed" state indefinitely, which the plan explicitly prohibits.

  Suggested: schedule a retry job (via existing `queue.enqueue`) with a 1h / 6h / 24h backoff, then mark the invoice `dunning` after three failures.

  ```ts
  if (event.type === "invoice.payment_failed") {
    logger.warn("Invoice payment failed", { invoiceId });
    return;  // ← missing retry
  }
  ```
```

If a section has no findings, include an empty list with "None" below:

```markdown
## Suggestions (consider improving)

None.
```

Do not omit empty sections — the reader needs to see that each tier was considered.

### Plan Item Traceability

Full table from step 3. Don't abbreviate. If a plan has 40 requirements, the table has 40 rows. Use horizontal scroll or wrap — do not cut rows.

Include non-goals as rows (prefix `NG-`) so the reader sees scope was audited.

### Files Changed

One-line summary per file. Derived from the inventory in step 2.

```markdown
- `src/api/invoices/route.ts` (M) — added GET with cursor pagination per US-1
- `src/billing/invoice-service.ts` (A) — new service; contains the retry gap (US-3)
- `src/db/schema.prisma` (M) — added `Invoice` and `InvoiceLineItem` models
- `docs/billing/invoice-architecture.md` (A) — architecture note per §2.1
```

Group by file path (alphabetical within the group) rather than by status.

---

## Voice and tone

- **Direct.** "The handler does not retry." Not "Looks like there might be no retry here, maybe?"
- **Cite evidence.** Every finding has a file, line, and (usually) a snippet.
- **Suggest, don't mandate.** "Suggested:" rather than "You must:". The author owns the fix.
- **No adjectives.** "Appalling", "terrible", "lovely" — none of these. Severity lives in the tier, not the prose.
- **No apologies or softeners.** "I think maybe", "just a thought", "probably" — cut all of these.

---

## Metadata block at the top

Before the Summary, include:

```markdown
# QA Report: <Plan Name>

**Plan document:** <path>
**Audit date:** <YYYY-MM-DD>
**Base branch:** <base branch, e.g., `main`>
**Head:** <current branch or SHA>
**Auditor:** quality-guardian
```

This lets a future reader reproduce the audit.

## Final check before saving

Run through this list:

- [ ] Every finding has `file:line` coordinates.
- [ ] Every finding has a severity matching `guides/05-severity-classification.md`.
- [ ] The Scorecard has exactly five rows.
- [ ] The traceability table includes every plan requirement — no silent omissions.
- [ ] The Files Changed list matches the inventory from step 2 exactly.
- [ ] No findings appear in more than one severity section.
- [ ] No section is missing (write "None" if empty).
- [ ] The file is saved at the correct path: feature audits in `library/requirements/features/feature-<###>-<title>/reports/`, issue audits in `library/requirements/issues/issue-<###>-<title>/reports/`, standalone audits in `library/qa/<domain>/`.

Then write the file. Then stop.

# Data Import UX: Designing Spreadsheet Imports Users Don't Hate | ImportCSV

## Summary
Comprehensive UX guide for designing CSV/XLSX import flows. Covers the canonical 5-stage flow, error UX patterns, template design, and validation feedback. The best single reference for `guides/08-error-reporting-ux.md` and `guides/02-column-mapping-ux.md`.

## Key quotations / statistics
- Canonical 5-stage import flow: Pre-import → Upload → Mapping → Validation → Confirmation
- "Provide scannable pre-import instructions (under 100 words) and downloadable templates"
- "Show accepted files, skipped files with reasons, row-level validation errors, and insert/update/failed counts"
- "Multi-sheet support: parse and list sheet names with small previews so users can select the correct sheet"
- Real-time validation during mapping stage reduces final submission errors
- Downloadable template reduces mapping errors significantly

## Annotations for weapon-forge
- This is the primary UX reference for `guides/08-error-reporting-ux.md` and the column-mapping wizard pattern
- The 5-stage flow (pre-import → upload → mapping → validation → confirmation) is the canonical pattern to encode in `guides/02-column-mapping-ux.md`
- Multi-sheet preview is a UX detail worth calling out specifically in the skill
- Downloadable template pattern is worth documenting as a standard best practice

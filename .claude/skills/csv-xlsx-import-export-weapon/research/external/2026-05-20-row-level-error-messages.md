# Show Row-Level Error Messages in Imports - CSVBox Blog

## Summary
Focused guide on implementing row-level error messages in CSV/XLSX imports. Explains why generic "import failed" messages destroy UX and how to surface actionable row-level feedback.

## Key quotations / statistics
- "Instead of generic failures like 'Import failed', systems should surface: exact row numbers and affected fields, human-readable actionable error messages, field-specific validation feedback"
- Example good error: "Missing license_number" or "Invalid date: expected YYYY-MM-DD"
- "Transforms a black-box failure into guidance users can act on immediately"

## Annotations for weapon-forge
- Core pattern for `guides/08-error-reporting-ux.md`: the `{row, col, message}` contract must produce human-readable messages, not technical codes
- The "YYYY-MM-DD expected" pattern shows that error messages should include the expected format, not just "invalid"

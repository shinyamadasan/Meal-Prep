# SheetJS vs ExcelJS vs node-xlsx 2026 - PkgPulse Guides

## Summary
2026 technical comparison of Node.js Excel libraries. SheetJS dominates by download volume (~7.8M weekly) but has significant limitations for formatting. ExcelJS (~1.9M weekly) is better for generating formatted Excel reports from scratch. node-xlsx is a thin wrapper with fewer features.

## Key quotations / statistics
- SheetJS: ~7.8M weekly downloads; 20+ file formats; works browser + Node.js
- ExcelJS: ~1.9M weekly downloads; better streaming API for large files; superior formatting control
- "SheetJS Community Edition silently drops data validations, strips styling, and loses embedded drawings on write operations"
- "ExcelJS has a sorting bug that duplicates data validations when reading/writing files with cross-sheet references"
- "SheetJS Pro (commercial) offers better features but requires payment"
- Neither library excels at preserving complex workbook features when round-tripping existing files

## Use case decision matrix
| Use case | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| Simple data read/write, multiple formats | SheetJS Community |
| Generated formatted Excel reports from scratch | ExcelJS |
| Server-side large file export with streaming | ExcelJS WorkbookWriter |
| Browser-side XLSX parse | SheetJS (with Web Worker) |
| Round-trip complex existing workbooks | Neither (consider xlsx-populate) |

## Annotations for weapon-forge
- This resolves Command Brief Q4 (ExcelJS vs xlsx-populate): ExcelJS is the winner for server-side generation; xlsx-populate is only relevant for modifying existing files (template fills)
- Critical warning for `guides/00-library-decision-tree.md`: SheetJS Community silently drops styling on write - developers expect styles to be preserved
- The "neither works well for round-tripping" finding is important: if users want to round-trip styled templates, document the limitation
- ExcelJS's cross-sheet validation bug should be mentioned as a known gotcha

# Provide Downloadable Error Reports for Failed Rows - CSVBox Blog

## Summary
Guide to generating downloadable CSV error reports for failed rows. The "error CSV" pattern lets users fix only the broken rows and re-upload rather than correcting the entire file.

## Key quotations / statistics
- Downloadable error CSV should contain: original input columns and values, a dedicated error column with concise validation messages, only failing rows (small file for corrections), optional metadata like row index and suggested fixes
- Reduces support tickets by up to 60%

## Annotations for weapon-forge
- This pattern should be documented in `guides/08-error-reporting-ux.md` as the "downloadable error report" UX pattern
- The error CSV format (original data + error column) is the canonical structure for the error export
- "Only failing rows" is important - don't include successful rows, keep the error file small and actionable

# Data Import UX: Designing Spreadsheet Imports Users Don't Hate

## Summary

ImportCSV's 2025-2026 practitioner guide on import UX synthesizes patterns from real-world spreadsheet import implementations. The core thesis is that import UX breaks at three failure points: unclear pre-import expectations, opaque error messages, and no path to partial recovery. Fixing all three dramatically reduces user abandonment and support volume.

The pre-import stage sets expectations through four mechanisms: scannable bullet-point requirements (under 100 words - not paragraphs), downloadable template files (CSV and XLSX), a file-format badge showing accepted extensions and max size, and "what will happen to your data" copy that names the columns the system expects. This stage prevents the most common failure mode: users uploading the wrong format or columns.

The column mapping step should present the user's uploaded column headers alongside the system's required fields with visual alignment cues (a two-column card layout: "Your column" | "Maps to"). Auto-matching should be attempted first (exact match → fuzzy match → no match), and the UI should group: (1) auto-matched columns (collapsed, with "looks right?" affordance), (2) unmatched required columns (expanded, blocking submission), and (3) unmatched optional columns (collapsed, with "skip" default). This three-group structure reduces the cognitive load of mapping 20+ columns.

The "fuzzy match" algorithm most commonly referenced in 2025-2026 implementations uses Levenshtein distance normalized by string length (below 0.3 normalized distance = confident match), combined with a synonym dictionary for common field aliases (e.g., "email address" → "email", "phone number" → "phone", "first name" → "name"). A confidence threshold is displayed to the user for each auto-match.

The confirmation step ("review before import") must show: total rows found, rows with errors (count and first N examples), rows that will be imported vs skipped, and a "download error report" link if any rows have errors. A "fix and re-upload" affordance (surfacing the downloadable error report) reduces the repeat-import friction that discourages users from correcting data.

- "Keep instructions under 100 words in scannable format (not paragraphs)" (importcsv.com/blog)
- "Provide downloadable CSV/XLSX templates with sample data and column examples" (importcsv.com/blog)
- Five-stage import UX: "Pre-import → Upload → Mapping → Validation → Confirmation" (importcsv.com/blog)

## Key takeaways for weapon-forge

- In `guides/03-column-mapping.md`, document the three-group mapping UI layout (auto-matched / unmatched-required / skip-optional) as the canonical UX pattern.
- Document the Levenshtein + synonym dictionary algorithm with a TypeScript implementation in `guides/03-column-mapping.md`.
- The "preview N rows" confirmation step is non-negotiable; users must see sample data before committing - document this as a required step in the import pipeline.
- The pre-import template download pattern directly maps to the `templates/` folder the weapon will produce; a downloadable XLSX with sample data should be one of the weapon's artifacts.
- The "under 100 words" copy rule for pre-import instructions is worth encoding as a UX contract in the weapon's guides.

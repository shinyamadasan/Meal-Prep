# SheetJS vs ExcelJS vs node-xlsx: 2026 Comparison for Node.js

## Summary

PkgPulse's 2026 guide compares the three dominant Node.js Excel libraries on format support, streaming capability, and real-world workbook fidelity. The conclusion is nuanced: SheetJS wins on raw format breadth (20+ formats including XLS, ODS, XLSB) and adoption (~7.8M weekly downloads vs ExcelJS's ~1.9M), but ExcelJS wins on streaming API clarity and formatted report generation.

SheetJS Community Edition (CE) lacks true streaming for reads - it loads the entire workbook into memory. The `readFile` and `read` APIs return an in-memory workbook object. For files > 20 MB this is a problem. SheetJS Pro adds a streaming reader, but Pro is commercial. The Community Edition workaround is to use `XLSX.stream.to_json()` for exports only (write streaming), not imports. A third emerging option, `xlsx-kit` (MIT license, 2026), provides both read and write streaming with a fixed-memory budget tested up to tens of millions of rows.

ExcelJS has a `createInputStream()` API for streaming reads: `workbook.xlsx.createInputStream()` returns a writable Node.js stream. Rows are emitted via the `row` event on the worksheet. This is the correct pattern for large XLSX imports on the server. However ExcelJS only supports XLSX and CSV (not XLS, ODS, or XLSB). For legacy `.xls` files, SheetJS CE remains the only free option.

Real-world round-trip testing (a blog post from mfyz.com, 2025) reveals both libraries struggle with complex workbooks: ExcelJS duplicates data validations on write; SheetJS CE strips most styling and data validations silently. Neither is suitable for "preserve-the-workbook-exactly" use cases without Pro features.

For the import path (ingest user data, not preserve their formatting), ExcelJS streaming is the clear server-side winner. For browser-side import, SheetJS CE's `XLSX.read(data, {type: "array"})` + `utils.sheet_to_json()` remains the dominant pattern because ExcelJS is a Node.js-only library.

## Key quotations / statistics

- "SheetJS: ~7.8M weekly downloads... ExcelJS: ~1.9M weekly downloads" (pkgpulse.com)
- "ExcelJS has a cleaner streaming API for large files" (pkgpulse.com)
- "For 2026, xlsx-kit emerges as an actively-maintained open-source alternative with MIT licensing and no feature paywall." (pkgpulse.com)

## API surface reference

```js
// ExcelJS server-side streaming import (Node.js only)
const workbook = new ExcelJS.Workbook();
const stream = fs.createReadStream("large-file.xlsx");
await workbook.xlsx.read(stream);
workbook.eachSheet((sheet) => {
  sheet.eachRow((row) => {
    // row.values[1..N] are the cell values
  });
});

// SheetJS browser-side import (CE)
const data = await file.arrayBuffer();
const wb = XLSX.read(data, { type: "array", cellDates: true });
const ws = wb.Sheets[wb.SheetNames[0]];
const rows = XLSX.utils.sheet_to_json(ws, { defval: null });
```

## Key takeaways for weapon-forge

- Use ExcelJS for server-side streaming of large XLSX files (> 10 MB); document the `createReadStream` + `workbook.xlsx.read(stream)` pattern in `guides/02-xlsx-parse.md`.
- Use SheetJS CE for browser-side XLSX parsing; it is the only viable free option in the browser context.
- Document `xlsx-kit` as an emerging alternative worth monitoring but not yet a first-line recommendation.
- Warn that SheetJS CE silently drops data validations and most styling - guide users who need formula preservation toward SheetJS Pro or a managed platform.
- The `cellDates: true` option in SheetJS is critical to prevent Excel date serial numbers (e.g., 45678) from appearing instead of JavaScript Date objects.

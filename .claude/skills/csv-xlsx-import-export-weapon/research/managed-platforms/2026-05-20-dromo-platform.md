# Dromo: Pricing, Features, and AI Column Mapping

## Summary

Dromo is a managed import platform that positions itself as the full-stack alternative to Flatfile and OneSchema, with white-labeling included on every plan (unlike competitors that charge for it separately). The platform uses GPT-powered column mapping as its AI feature, auto-mapping uploaded columns to schema fields using semantic understanding rather than pure string matching.

Dromo's Professional plan starts at $499/month for 250 production imports, with additional imports at $2.50 each. The plan supports files up to 100,000 rows. The Enterprise plan supports 10M+ row files with unlimited imports - this is the tier that addresses the large-file streaming requirement from the Command Brief.

Dromo's "Private Mode" is a notable security feature: when enabled, Dromo's servers never see the customer's data (processing happens client-side). This is a meaningful differentiator for HIPAA-sensitive or financial data imports where data residency is a concern. The platform is SOC 2 Type II and HIPAA compliant on all plans.

The embedded importer deploys in ~10 lines of JavaScript/React and supports CSV, Excel (XLS/XLSX), and TSV formats. Dromo's `formulaMode` is configurable; the recommended safe configuration is `formulaMode: "disabled"` to prevent formula injection at the platform level (directly addressing the Command Brief's critical directive).

Dromo's headless API (Enterprise only) enables programmatic imports without the UI component, useful for server-to-server data pipeline use cases. SFTP ingestion is also an Enterprise feature. The comparison matrix on dromo.io positions Dromo as the best value for startups that need enterprise features (white-label, SOC2) at mid-market prices.

## Key quotations / statistics

- "Professional Plan: $499/month includes 250 production imports per month... Enterprise Plan supports 10M+ row files." (dromo.io/pricing)
- "Private Mode: Dromo never sees your data when using private mode." (dromo.io)
- "White Labeling: Full brand customization included on every plan (not hidden behind paywalls)." (dromo.io/pricing)

## Key takeaways for weapon-forge

- In `guides/00-library-selection.md` comparison table, include Dromo with pricing ($499/mo Professional, Enterprise custom), file size limits (100K rows Professional, 10M+ Enterprise), and Private Mode as a key differentiator.
- `formulaMode: "disabled"` is Dromo's configuration key for CSV injection prevention - document this in `guides/06-csv-injection.md` alongside OneSchema and Flatfile equivalents.
- Private Mode makes Dromo the best choice for HIPAA/financial data use cases among managed platforms.
- The 100,000-row Professional plan limit is a significant constraint for data-heavy SaaS; flag this clearly in the decision guide.
- AI column mapping via GPT is a differentiator but adds latency to the mapping step; document trade-off in `guides/03-column-mapping.md`.

# OneSchema: Column Mapping UX and 2026 Customizations

## Summary

OneSchema is a managed import platform that positions itself on implementation speed (claimed 1-day integration) and customizability of the column mapping experience. The platform's Map Columns pane is the central UX surface where users match their uploaded spreadsheet's columns to the developer-defined template columns.

OneSchema's column matching operates at three levels: exact text matching (applied automatically, no user action required), fuzzy matching (configurable sensitivity), and historical matching (learns from previous user sessions for the same tenant). Exact matches are applied silently; only unmatched columns are presented to the user. Empty columns (all cells blank) are auto-detected and pre-skipped by default.

When 100% exact matching is detected, OneSchema can skip the Map Columns pane entirely, creating a near-zero-friction import for users who always upload correctly formatted files. This is a key differentiator for internal-tool use cases where file format is controlled.

The 2026 Customizations Dashboard (announced via OneSchema blog) added 20+ new configuration options including: template column guidance (sidebar showing column info before upload), Excel template download (users get a pre-formatted XLSX template generated from the schema), and tiered automation levels for column matching. These features reduce repetitive mapping work for repeat users.

The platform's docs distinguish between "template columns" (developer-defined required/optional schema fields) and "uploaded columns" (the user's actual spreadsheet headers). The mapping step produces a mapping object that the developer's code receives via webhook or SDK callback, containing `{ uploadedColumn: string, templateColumn: string }` pairs.

OneSchema does not publish a hard file size limit in the 2026 docs for the managed hosted path. The community note (from the Command Brief questions) remains unresolved: whether OneSchema natively handles 100 MB+ files via browser-side streaming or requires server-side pre-processing. The FileFeed comparison report (2026) suggests OneSchema handles up to 1 million rows in the hosted path.

## Key quotations / statistics

- "OneSchema recently launched 20+ new customization options in its Customizations Dashboard." (oneschema.co/blog/customizations-dashboard)
- "Template column guidance: A sidebar showing template column information before upload." (OneSchema Customizations Dashboard blog)
- "For files with identical column structures, OneSchema can skip the Map Columns pane entirely if 100% exact matching is detected." (docs.oneschema.co)

## Key takeaways for weapon-forge

- Document the three-level matching hierarchy (exact > fuzzy > historical) in `guides/03-column-mapping.md`; it is the UX model developers should replicate in a DIY mapper.
- The "skip Map Columns for 100% exact match" pattern is a quality-of-life win worth implementing even in a DIY mapper; add it to the column-mapping guide.
- OneSchema is recommended for SaaS products with diverse customer file formats; flag the unresolved question about 100 MB+ file limits as an open question for the weapon.
- `formulaMode` in OneSchema: the platform doc explicitly warns developers to keep formula execution off by default - this aligns with the Command Brief's critical directive.
- For the comparison guide, note that OneSchema's 1-day implementation claim is credible for React apps due to the `@oneschema/react` SDK embed.

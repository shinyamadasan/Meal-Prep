name: csv-xlsx-import-export-weapon
description: The "upload your spreadsheet" implementation arsenal for React/Next.js products. Covers library selection (papaparse, SheetJS, exceljs), streaming-parse for 100MB+ files, the column-mapping UX wizard, managed importers (OneSchema, Flatfile, dromo) vs self-hosted (react-spreadsheet-import), Zod row validation, CSV injection prevention, encoding edge cases, and styled XLSX export. Use when the user says "build a CSV import", "add XLSX upload", "spreadsheet import feature", "column-mapping wizard", "export to Excel", "streaming parse large file", "CSV injection safety", or when csv-xlsx-import-export-guardian is invoked. Do NOT use for file drop-zone UI (ux-ui-guardian), database bulk-insert tuning (db-guardian), or upload endpoint security audit (security-guardian).

# csv-xlsx-import-export Weapon

Procedural arsenal for `csv-xlsx-import-export-guardian`. Encodes every decision the Angel needs to make when helping a team add "upload your spreadsheet" to a React/Next.js product.

This weapon is deliberately opinionated: it picks winners from the research and explains the trade-offs rather than presenting false symmetry. When the research surfaces a gotcha (SheetJS cannot stream XLSX, ExcelJS WorkbookWriter has a memory leak), the guides encode the workaround, not the happy fiction.

## When this weapon applies

Load when the Angel is invoked on any of:

- "Build a CSV import feature"
- "Add XLSX file upload"
- "Column-mapping wizard for my importer"
- "Parse a 100MB spreadsheet without freezing the browser"
- "Export data to Excel with styled headers"
- "Is my CSV export safe from formula injection?"
- "Compare OneSchema vs Flatfile vs dromo vs hand-rolled"
- "Why is SheetJS not streaming my XLSX?"

Do NOT load for:

- Generic file upload drop-zone UX (ux-ui-guardian owns the react-dropzone + progress indicator surface).
- Database upsert performance after import (db-guardian).
- Server-side upload endpoint hardening (security-guardian must audit the endpoint before production).

## First action when this weapon is loaded

Read these in order before doing anything else:

1. **`guides/00-library-decision-tree.md`** -- pick the right library stack for the user's constraints before writing a line of code.
2. **`guides/04-csv-injection-prevention.md`** -- the sanitization rule is non-negotiable; read it early so it is never forgotten.
3. **`research/research-summary.md`** -- the five headline findings from scripture-historian, including the SheetJS streaming gotcha and ExcelJS memory leak.

Then walk the remaining guides in order of the task at hand. Each guide is self-contained.

## Critical directives (from the Command Brief)

- **Never skip CSV injection sanitization even if the import target is a database, not Excel.** Why: exported data may be re-downloaded as CSV and opened in Excel later, creating a deferred injection surface. See `guides/04-csv-injection-prevention.md`.
- **Always specify the streaming strategy for files over 5 MB.** Why: synchronous `readAsArrayBuffer` on a 100 MB XLSX freezes the browser main thread and crashes low-RAM devices. See `guides/01-streaming-parse-large-files.md`.
- **Distinguish browser-side vs. server-side parse.** Why: SheetJS and exceljs have different APIs, memory models, and security profiles. See `guides/00-library-decision-tree.md`.
- **Do not recommend a managed importer without noting the pricing model.** Why: OneSchema has no free tier and a ~$38K/year median contract; Flatfile has 50 files/month free; Dromo starts at $499/month. See `guides/02-column-mapping-ux.md`.
- **Always validate and report errors at the row level, not just file level.** Why: row-level errors let users fix and re-upload rather than starting over. See `guides/08-error-reporting-ux.md`.
- **Hand off to `security-guardian` before any upload endpoint reaches production.** Why: file parsing is a classic attack surface (zip bombs, billion-laughs via XLSX shared strings, path traversal). The weapon covers sanitization but not endpoint hardening.

## Key gotchas from research

These are not in the official docs but emerged from the 2026 literature sweep:

1. **SheetJS cannot stream-read XLSX.** The ZIP container requires buffering the full file. Use a Web Worker to keep the main thread responsive. `xlsx-stream-rows` (maintenance status unverified -- check before recommending as primary solution) offers true bounded-memory iteration. See `guides/01-streaming-parse-large-files.md` and `research/external/2026-05-20-sheetjs-streaming-api.md`.

2. **ExcelJS WorkbookWriter memory leak.** Issue #2916, PR #2558 pending for v5.0. Workaround: call `row.commit()` on every row immediately after writing. Do NOT accumulate rows in memory. See `guides/06-export-xlsx.md` and `research/external/2026-05-20-exceljs-github-readme.md`.

3. **Tab-prefix CSV injection survives Excel save/reopen ~90% of the time; single-quote does not.** Layer all three defenses (cell sanitization + correct Content-Type + Content-Disposition). See `guides/04-csv-injection-prevention.md` and `research/external/2026-05-20-csv-injection-dead-ends.md`.

4. **react-spreadsheet-import (RSI) adds Chakra UI.** For shadcn/ui stacks, this means ~200KB+ bundle addition. Prefer the hand-rolled wizard from `examples/column-mapping-wizard.tsx` or the `bow-react-spreadsheet-import` fork for Chakra-free teams. See `guides/02-column-mapping-ux.md`.

5. **Dromo processes data client-side (Private Mode) on all plans.** OneSchema and Flatfile process server-side. This matters for GDPR/HIPAA -- only Dromo guarantees PII never leaves the browser. See `guides/02-column-mapping-ux.md` and `research/external/2026-05-20-oneschema-vs-dromo-comparison.md`.

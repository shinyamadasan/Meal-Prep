**The single most important conceptual guide in this weapon.** Read before interpreting any Lighthouse score alongside CrUX data.

## The core distinction

| | Lab data (Lighthouse) | Field data (CrUX / PSI `loadingExperience`) |
|---|---|---|
| Source | Controlled simulation in Lighthouse | Real Chrome users in the wild |
| Measurement | Single synthetic load | Aggregated from user sessions (28-day rolling) |
| Metric availability | All Lighthouse metrics, including TBT | INP, LCP, CLS, FCP, TTFB (no TBT) |
| INP | Not available (TBT is proxy) | Available as p75 |
| Throttling | Fixed (mobile 4x CPU / 1.6 Mbps) | Actual user device and connection |
| Cache state | Always cold | Mixed (new and repeat visitors) |
| Use for | Debugging and regression detection | Prioritization and real-user impact |

## Why lab and field diverge: the cause table

| Cause | Metrics affected | Direction of lab vs field gap |
|-------|-----------------|-------------------------------|
| Network throttling mismatch (Lighthouse: 1.6 Mbps / 150ms RTT; US average: ~41 Mbps / 47ms) | LCP, FCP | Lab typically worse than field |
| CPU throttling (4x mobile simulation) | LCP, TBT | Lab typically worse than field |
| Cold vs warm cache (Lighthouse always cold; repeat visitors cache resources) | LCP, TTFB | Lab worse; field improves for repeat visitors |
| Geographic variation (Lighthouse runs from one location) | LCP, TTFB | Field varies by user geography |
| User interaction (Lighthouse doesn't interact) | INP | INP unavailable in lab |
| bfcache / platform optimizations | LCP | Field benefits from bfcache; lab cannot replicate |

## The TBT / INP gap: the critical caveat

TBT measures blocking tasks during page load. INP measures the full interaction lifecycle (delay + processing + presentation). They are related but not the same.

**A page can have excellent TBT (< 200ms) and still fail INP (> 200ms).**

Why: "This delay counts toward a page's INP because it contributes to the real input latency that users experience. But since this delay is not technically a Long Task, it doesn't affect a page's TBT." — web.dev, `research/external/2026-05-20-lab-vs-field-data-differences.md`

Real-world example from the research: Discord homepage has 3+ seconds TBT but INP of 81ms. The reverse is also true and more common.

**Practical rule:** Never conclude that INP is fine because TBT is green. Always check field INP via PSI or CrUX API directly.

## The PSI API: lab + field in one call

The PageSpeed Insights API response contains two top-level blocks:

1. **`lighthouseResult`** — the full Lighthouse lab audit (score, audits, opportunities)
2. **`loadingExperience`** — CrUX field data for the URL (p75 LCP, INP, CLS, FCP, TTFB, with GOOD/NEEDS_IMPROVEMENT/POOR category per metric)

The `loadingExperience` block falls back from URL-level to origin-level if insufficient URL-level CrUX data exists. If even origin-level data is unavailable, the block indicates no data.

## Which tool for which job

| Job | Tool |
|-----|------|
| On-demand lab + field in one call | PSI API |
| Fast field-only query for a URL | CrUX API |
| Weekly field trends over time | CrUX History API |
| 3-month CWV by URL group (ranking signals) | Google Search Console |
| Historical field data with country/ECT dimensions | CrUX on BigQuery |
| Historical lab data with commit-level regression tracking | Self-hosted LHCI server |

**Note:** The CrUX Dashboard was deprecated in November 2025. Migrate to CrUX Vis or BigQuery.

> TODO: open question — confirm whether CrUX Vis is now the official Google-maintained replacement for the Dashboard (needs human verification at https://developer.chrome.com/docs/crux/tools/crux-vis).

## The reconciliation workflow

When a user reports "Lighthouse says 90 but CrUX says I'm failing":

1. Pull the PSI API response for the exact URL and strategy (mobile vs desktop).
2. Compare `lighthouseResult.categories.performance.score` vs `loadingExperience.metrics`.
3. Identify which specific metric is failing in field data (usually INP, sometimes LCP).
4. Check if Lighthouse lab score is green because TBT is excellent — but field INP is poor.
5. If LCP diverges: check for cold vs warm cache, geographic variation, bfcache.
6. Use Chrome DevTools Performance panel with CPU throttling matching Lighthouse settings for deeper lab debugging.
7. Use `examples/lab-field-reconciliation.md` for a worked walkthrough.

## Field data thresholds (Core Web Vitals, 2026)

| Metric | Good | Needs Improvement | Poor |
|--------|------|------------------|------|
| LCP | ≤ 2.5s | 2.5s - 4.0s | > 4.0s |
| INP | ≤ 200ms | 200ms - 500ms | > 500ms |
| CLS | ≤ 0.1 | 0.1 - 0.25 | > 0.25 |

Field data passes a metric if the **p75 (75th percentile)** is in the "Good" bucket. 3 of every 4 user sessions must be Good.

As of April 2026: 56.4% of origins pass all three Core Web Vitals. — `research/external/2026-05-20-crux-release-notes-2026.md`

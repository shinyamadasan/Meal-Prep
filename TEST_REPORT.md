## TASK-007 · 2026-07-08 (re-applied on main)
suite: node --check app.js; git apply --3way (feature hunks from d8acde3); npx playwright test tests/smoke.spec.js tests/button-smoke.spec.js --reporter=line; acceptance code-trace
result: `node --check` passed. Feature hunks applied cleanly onto current main (deduct at app.js:7280, check at 7312, `_doMarkCooked` at 7350, `markRecipeCooked` at 7395). `smoke.spec.js` + `button-smoke.spec.js` passed (2 passed; 460 buttons discovered, 200 clicked, 0 broken). Code-trace verified all 8 acceptance criteria: default-param backward-compat; `scaledQty *= multiplier` in deduct + check before `toGrams`; cookHistory `servings` rounded to 2 dp; `(×N)` toast only when `!== 1`; `cookedMeals` untouched; scaled missing-check runs before cook; captured-reference input read (correct for showConfirmDialog's close-before-onConfirm ordering); invalid/empty → 1× fallback.
untested: runtime multiplier deductions (2× / 0.5× / invalid) and real-device rendering remain human verification — the smoke suite does not drive the cook dialog. Pre-existing `buttons-functional.spec.js` / `recipe-actions.spec.js` fixture failures are unrelated (documented in prior TASK entries).

## TASK-008 · 2026-07-06
suite: deterministic parser check for `confirmBulkAdd()` inline expiry preprocessing; git diff --check; npm test; npx playwright test --reporter=list --workers=1 --timeout=30000; npx playwright test tests/mobile-layout.spec.js --reporter=list --workers=1 --timeout=30000; npx playwright test tests/smoke.spec.js --reporter=list --workers=1 --timeout=30000; npx playwright test tests/button-smoke.spec.js --reporter=list --workers=1 --timeout=240000; npx playwright test tests/mobile-layout.spec.js tests/recipe-actions.spec.js --reporter=list --workers=1 --timeout=30000
result: deterministic parser check passed 5/5 cases (no token, shared expiry, per-line override, invalid matching date fallback warning, spaced `exp:` no-match). `git diff --check` passed with only Git LF-to-CRLF warnings. `mobile-layout.spec.js` passed 1/1; `smoke.spec.js` passed 1/1; `button-smoke.spec.js` passed 1/1. `npm test` timed out after 124s; full single-worker Playwright timed out after 184s; `buttons-functional.spec.js` timed out after 244s without reporter output. Split local run passed `mobile-layout.spec.js` and failed 2/2 `recipe-actions.spec.js` cases because recipe-card controls were hidden in that fixture; no failure traced to TASK-008 changes.
untested: full Playwright suite completion remains unverified because suite commands timed out; direct browser bulk-add check could not run because direct `chromium.launch` failed with `spawn EPERM`; real-device rendering remains human verification

## TASK-006 · 2026-07-05
suite: npm test -- --reporter=list; npx playwright test --reporter=list --workers=1 --timeout=60000 --global-timeout=300000; npx playwright test tests/mobile-layout.spec.js --reporter=list --workers=1 --timeout=60000; static QA/code trace for `#bulk-add-default-storage`
result: targeted mobile-layout spec passed (1/1). Full single-worker run passed `button-smoke.spec.js`, then failed/timeboxed in `buttons-functional.spec.js` (1 passed, 3 failed, 17 did not run) because `#kitchen-setup-modal` intercepted nav clicks and `#add-recipe-btn` was hidden. Initial npm test timed out after 244s without reporter output. No failure traced to TASK-006 changes.
untested: full Playwright suite completion remains unverified; direct selector browser check could not run because direct `chromium.launch` failed with `spawn EPERM` and a temporary-spec command was sandbox-blocked; real-device rendering remains human verification

## TASK-004 · 2026-07-03
suite: npx playwright test tests/mobile-layout.spec.js --reporter=list; npm test -- --reporter=list
result: mobile-layout spec ran past onboarding/nav fixture blockers and failed on a real overflow finding: `planner (+23px)`; full suite timed out after 304s
untested: full Playwright suite completion remains unverified because `npm test` timed out

## TASK-003 · 2026-07-03
suite: targeted local Playwright modal check; npx playwright test tests/mobile-layout.spec.js --reporter=list; npm test -- --reporter=list
result: targeted check passed; mobile-layout spec failed before relevant assertions because `#kitchen-setup-modal` intercepted `.tab-btn[data-tab="recipes"]`; full suite timed out after 304s
untested: full Playwright suite completion remains unverified because `npm test` timed out; real-device rendering remains human verification

## TASK-002 · 2026-07-03
suite: targeted local Playwright modal check; npx playwright test tests/mobile-layout.spec.js --reporter=list; npm test -- --reporter=list
result: targeted check passed; mobile-layout spec failed before relevant assertions because `#kitchen-setup-modal` intercepted `.tab-btn[data-tab="recipes"]`; full suite timed out after 304s
untested: full Playwright suite completion remains unverified because `npm test` timed out; real-device rendering remains human verification

## TASK-001 · 2026-07-03
suite: npm test
result: not completed — sandbox run failed with `spawn EPERM`; approved runs timed out after 124s and 304s
untested: visual browser baseline and full Playwright suite remain unverified. Diagnostic `npx playwright test tests/mobile-layout.spec.js --workers=1 --reporter=list --timeout=60000` failed before the CSS overflow assertion because `#kitchen-setup-modal` intercepted the `.tab-btn[data-tab="recipes"]` click.
